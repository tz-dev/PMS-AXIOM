# PMS–AXIOM

## A Praxeological Cartography of Classical Closure-Demands Across the PMS Stack (Δ–Ψ)

**PMS–AXIOM is a formal cartographic application of the [Praxeological Meta-Structure (PMS)](https://github.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory)** — a generative operator framework (Δ–Ψ) for modelling praxis, asymmetry, temporality, and self-binding.

While PMS provides the **canonical operator grammar** for analysing action and non-action, **PMS–AXIOM compiles classical philosophical and governance-relevant problem families** into a **uniform, stack-explicit case suite**.
Rather than resolving problems at the level of truth, morality, or psychology, PMS–AXIOM reconstructs them as **structural closure-demands inside explicit frames (□)**, with identifiable residues (Λ), operator chains, drift risks, and admissible output types.

Building explicitly on PMS as its structural foundation, this project does **not modify or extend the PMS operator set**, but uses it **strictly as specified** to show:

* how classical “axioms” and problem labels function as **closure-demands**, not ontological claims,
* why many disputes persist due to **residue structures (Λ)** rather than disagreement,
* how **asymmetry (Ω)** and **temporality (Θ)** redistribute costs even when “nothing happens,”
* where recontextualization (Φ) without integration (Σ) produces analytic drift,
* and why escalation into governance requires **explicit mode declaration**, not implicit authority.

In this sense, PMS–AXIOM should be read as:

* **conceptually dependent on PMS**,
* **formally consistent with the PMS operator grammar**, and
* **focused on structural legibility rather than explanation, judgment, or prescription**.

## What PMS–AXIOM Is

PMS–AXIOM is:

* A **cartography paper**, not a new theory
* A **PMS_1.1–conform application suite** of the operator grammar (Δ–Ψ)
* A framework for compiling:

  * classical philosophical problems as **bounded structural artefacts**
  * closure-demands under explicit frames (□)
  * irreducible residues (Λ) and non-closure
  * operator chains (Δ–Ψ) and reduced signatures
  * domain-specific drift risks via non-mixing overlays
* A discipline for producing **uniform, machine-readable case artefacts** suitable for:

  * comparison across domains
  * audit-sensitive contexts
  * downstream governance evaluation (where explicitly declared)

**Guiding formula:**

> **Non-ontological in framing /
> Operator-strict in analysis /
> Guardrailed in application**

---

## What PMS–AXIOM Is *Not*

PMS–AXIOM is not:

* A grand metaphysical or moral theory
* A psychological or diagnostic framework
* A method for intervention, therapy, or coaching
* A system for ranking persons or resolving disputes
* A governance or enforcement mechanism

PMS–AXIOM treats problems as **praxeological configurations** —
not as errors of belief, failures of character, or deficits of virtue.

---

## Core Thesis

PMS–AXIOM argues that:

* Many classical problems persist because they are misframed as ontological or moral disputes.
* When reconstructed as **closure-demands**, their limits become structurally visible.
* Residues (Λ) are not failures but **necessary remainders**.
* Drift is predictable when closure pressure exceeds structural capacity.
* Governance relevance begins only when outputs acquire downstream force — and must be declared as such.

> Problems do not end where answers fail.
> They end where structural closure is exhausted.

## Relation to PMS

PMS–AXIOM is built directly on the **canonical PMS operator grammar (Δ–Ψ)** as defined in
[`PMS.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory/refs/heads/main/model/PMS.yaml)
(schema_version: `PMS_1.1`).

* No new operators are introduced
* No operator is redefined
* All dependency rules are respected
* All readings remain **scene-bound, reversible, and non-diagnostic**

Where PMS provides the **grammar of praxis**,
PMS–AXIOM specifies how that grammar behaves when applied to:

* classical philosophical problems,
* governance-relevant disputes,
* asymmetry-laden coordination failures,
* non-events, delays, and silence,
* and escalation boundaries between analysis and authority.

## What You Can Do With PMS.yaml + PMS–AXIOM (That PMS Alone Does Not Provide)

PMS.yaml gives you the **canonical operator system** (Δ–Ψ), dependency hygiene, derived structures, and validity constraints.

PMS–AXIOM adds a **case-level cartographic layer** that makes several things **explicitly recordable, comparable, and auditable**:

### 1) Uniform case artefacts

Each problem instance is compiled into the same minimal structure:

* explicit frame (□)
* closure-demand
* Λ-residue
* operator chain
* overlay signatures
* drift risks
* admissible output type
* optional governance hooks

This replaces assertion-driven discourse with **inspectable artefacts**.

### 2) Stack-explicit outputs

PMS–AXIOM distinguishes three stack depths:

* **Level I:** PMS only (structural legibility)
* **Level II:** PMS + Add-on (domain lens)
* **Level III:** PMS + Add-on + MIP (+ AH) (governance)

Movement between levels is treated as a **substantive escalation**, not an interpretive flourish.

### 3) Domain overlays without operator mixing

PMS–AXIOM uses PMS add-ons (LOGIC, ANTICIPATION, CONFLICT, CRITIQUE, EDEN, SEX, QC/EXT) as:

* reduced signatures
* drift catalogues
* guardrail amplifiers

They **do not introduce new operators** and **must not be mixed**.

### 4) Misuse resistance by construction

Each case enforces:

* the PMS entry gate (Χ + reversibility + D),
* explicit output type declaration,
* reader guards against authority laundering,
* and termination rules where analysis must stop.

---

## PMS–AXIOM Case Schema (Appendix A)

This repository includes a **canonical, annotated case schema** used throughout the paper.

The schema:

* is machine-readable (YAML),
* enforces scope discipline,
* prevents person-evaluation,
* and preserves reversibility and dignity-in-practice constraints.

See **Appendix A** in the paper for the full specification.

---

## Intended Use

PMS–AXIOM is intended for:

* structural theorists
* philosophers seeking non-ontological problem reformulation
* governance and policy analysts
* AI and systems researchers working with formal models
* readers interested in **where analysis must stop**

It is **not** intended for decision-making, enforcement, or moral adjudication.

Any application must respect the **PMS entry condition**:
**Χ (distance) + reversibility + D (dignity-in-practice)**.

---

## Final Note

PMS–AXIOM does not solve classical problems.

It shows **why many of them cannot be solved in the way they are usually framed** —
and what remains once structural closure is exhausted.

> PMS provides the operator theory.
> PMS–AXIOM shows how to use it without drift, misuse, or authority laundering — and where to stop.

### Contribution scope (structural only)

In scope:

* additional case mappings following the schema and guardrails,
* clarifications of drift or closure patterns,
* documentation improvements that strengthen misuse resistance,
* tooling that consumes PMS.yaml + PMS-AXIOM cases without redefining operators.

Out of scope:

* new operators or dependency changes,
* person-typing or diagnostic language,
* normative or enforcement claims,
* implicit governance without declaration.
