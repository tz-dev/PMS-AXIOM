    context: >
      A QC workflow (circuit or hybrid DAG) contains one or more oracle-like components:
      black-box functions, controlled unitaries, marking or phase-kickback primitives,
      or measurement mappings that privilege one subsystem over another. The audit targets
      Ω-sites (oracle privilege and directionality), their framing (□), repetition (Θ),
      integration commits (Σ), and governance bindings (Ψ), producing an audit-ready trace
      rather than a proof of correctness or performance.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Oracle-asymmetry is treated as a structural property of the workflow: which components
        act with privileged informational or causal direction (Ω), under which declared scope
        (□), and under which governance constraints (Ψ). Oracle calls must be explicitly
        dominated by an active frame; post-Σ reframing of oracle semantics is invalid unless
        mediated by explicit Ψ revision rules.
      protected_constraints:
        - "Structural audit only; no physical/noise claims."
        - "No correctness, advantage, or performance guarantees derived from audit passing."
        - "Ω must be enumerated as a set of auditable sites (oracle calls, controlled ops, measurement mappings)."
        - "Σ commit points must be logged; post-Σ semantic rewrite requires explicit Ψ revision policy."
        - "Distance (Χ) maintained: audit is not enforcement, verdict, or certification."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Hardware-level verification, calibration, or safety certification."
        - "Formal oracle identification beyond declared interface contracts."
        - "Gate-level optimisation, transpilation strategy, or device benchmarking."
        - "Claims that governance checks imply correctness, security, or advantage."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "Design-time review → execution-time enforcement → post-hoc audit"
      iteration_rhythm: >
        Oracle calls may be single-shot (one Ω-site) or repeated (Θ^k) in Grover-like cycles,
        phase-estimation ladders, or hybrid loops. Repetition must be explicit and bounded by
        Ψ policies if used for governance.

    nabla_impulse: >
      Pressure to rely on black-box components for leverage (speed, simplicity, modularity),
      to increase oracle calls under uncertainty, or to treat oracle semantics as stable even
      when versioning and scope are unclear.

        □ defines the oracle domain: register decomposition, interface contract, admissible inputs,
        and what counts as "oracle semantics." Oracle calls must be dominated by an explicit □ in scope.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Ω is instantiated by oracle calls and controlled operations that privilege one subsystem's
        influence over another (e.g., marking, phase kickback, controlled-U ladders), and by
        measurement mappings that privilege classical readout/control over quantum alternatives.
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ captures repetition of oracle privilege: Grover-style cycles, QPE ladders (Θ^t), hybrid loops.
        Governance must track and, if required, bound Θ depth for auditability.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ captures what is absent but expected: missing oracle specs, missing versioning, missing logs,
        and unrealised branches that are collapsed or discarded without being represented in the audit.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Α captures stabilised reliance on black-box components (template creep): repeated use becomes
        the default pathway, potentially substituting for explicit coordination of oracle semantics.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ becomes salient when oracle meaning shifts (basis change, interface change, version change).
        Φ after Σ is invalid unless explicitly mediated by Ψ revision rules and trace continuity.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ marks commit points where oracle semantics are treated as fixed for downstream reasoning,
        execution, or publication. Σ requires trace continuity for oracle contracts and invocation logs.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ binds admissible oracle usage: explicit policies (no_unframed_omega, depth guards, version
        pinning, logging requirements, revision rules). Ψ is governance, not correctness guarantee.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ is an application gate: maintain reflective distance so the audit does not become a verdict,
        certification claim, or enforcement proxy.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signatures are shorthand. Canonical PMS dependencies remain authoritative.
      In particular: Θ presupposes Ω/Α; Σ presupposes Χ/Φ; Ψ presupposes Σ/Θ/Χ.
      Therefore oracle auditing must treat Ω-sites together with Θ repetition, Σ commits,
      and Ψ governance bindings; otherwise the audit is structurally incomplete.

        how_it_applies_here: >
          Oracle calls without explicit frame scope are flagged as invalid for governance traces,

        title: "Σ commit point freezes oracle semantics"
        formula: "Σ(commit) ⇒ no Φ semantic rewrite unless Ψ revision rule"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Once the workflow is committed (execution/publication), oracle semantics must remain stable
          for the trace; if they change, the trace must branch via explicit Ψ-governed versioning.

        how_it_applies_here: >
          If the workflow uses laddered oracle structures (QPE-like), QC-EXT helps represent non-linear
          repetition as explicit Θ structure and supports depth-guard policy checks.

        why_plausible_here: >

        why_plausible_here: >
          Passing frame/Ω checks may be rhetorically converted into proof language; this collapses Χ
          and violates the non-guarantee clause of QC governance.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      QC makes Ω-sites concrete as audit objects (oracle calls, controlled ops, measurement directionality),
      supplies macro-level handles and policy checks, and provides logging requirements so Λ (missing
      spec/logs) becomes visible. PMS core alone would note asymmetry but not provide QC-native audit hooks.

      Oracle providers/components hold privileged informational/capability position relative to callers.
      Measurement introduces a structural directionality from quantum alternatives to classical control.
      Controlled operations privilege control registers over targets; repeated Ω amplifies these gradients.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Repeated oracle calls increase workflow depth, review burden, and downstream dependency on oracle
      semantics. After Σ, changing oracle definitions forces re-audit; without Ψ revision rules, lock-in
      becomes implicit and auditability collapses.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Missing oracle contracts, missing logs, and missing version pinning accumulate as Λ-residue:
      ambiguity in what the oracle "was," unverifiable claims about invocations, and post-hoc narrative

    risk_point: >
      Audit traces are treated as certificates: oracle usage is laundered into authority claims

    structural_indicator: >
      Χ collapses (audit becomes enforcement); Ψ bounds are narrated as guarantees; Φ-after-Σ rewrites

    misuse_warning: >
      Do not convert oracle-asymmetry audit traces into certification, enforcement, or proof language.
      Keep the output scene-bound, revisable, and limited to structural governance visibility.

  structural_closure: >
    Oracle-asymmetry audit is structurally valid only when Ω-sites (oracle calls, controlled ops, measurement
    directionality) are explicit, dominated by declared frames (□), tracked under repetition (Θ), frozen at
    commit points (Σ), and bounded by governance bindings (Ψ) that include logging and revision rules.
    Drift is prepared when oracles become implicit black boxes (Λ invisibility), Θ escalates under ∇ pressure,
    and Φ-after-Σ rewrites reinterpret oracle semantics post-hoc.

  plain_language_summary: >
    This case checks where a quantum workflow depends on “oracle-like” privileged components and whether
    that privilege is clearly scoped, logged, and governed. An oracle is powerful because it acts with
    directionality: it can mark states, apply controlled influence, or collapse outcomes into classical
    decisions. The audit is good when oracle calls are explicitly framed, their repetition is declared and
    bounded, and any committed meaning can’t be rewritten later without a tracked revision rule. Passing
    the audit doesn’t prove the algorithm works—it just makes the workflow inspectable.
