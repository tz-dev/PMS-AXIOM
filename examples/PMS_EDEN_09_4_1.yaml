        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can represent asymmetry (Ω), temporality (Θ), recontextualization (Φ),
          distance (Χ), integration (Σ), and binding (Ψ). But PMS core alone does not
          explicitly label the regime where rhetorical equality inside a comparison-dominant
          frame substitutes for coordination, nor does it provide EDEN-specific drift
          handles (PS adjacency, Σ-simulation, Ψ misbinding/externalization corridors).
          The EDEN overlay adds regime labels, reduced signatures, drift corridors, and
          observable markers so pseudo-symmetry becomes legible as a structural substitution
          pattern (not as intent, character, or moral failure).

  scene_packet:

    context: >
      A recurring relational or institutional setting in which parity is verbally asserted
      (“we are equal / it’s the same for both”) while outcomes, exposure, burdens, or
      obligations remain asymmetrically distributed. Attempts to name the functional gradient
      are reframed as “making it about yourself,” “being unfair,” or “breaking harmony.”
      The configuration stabilizes through repeated scripts and narrative repairs rather than
      through explicit interface negotiation.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: "comparison-dominant frame asserting equality (value-relation capture)"
      protected_constraints:
        - "parity claims treated as non-negotiable (frame-level axiom)"
        - "explicit asymmetry talk is discouraged/tabooed"
        - "questions treated as relational threats (Χ priced as 'attack')"
      out_of_frame:
        - "functional gradient coordination (Ω speakable as a gradient)"
        - "explicit interface negotiation (Σ as durable adjustment)"
        - "scene-bound revision windows (Χ protected as repair function)"
    temporality:
      time_scale: "medium- to long-term (weeks to years)"
      iteration_rhythm: "repeated interaction cycles with episodic flare-ups"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "protocolized scripts (Α): surface agreement + reset"
        - "narrative repair loops (Φ): parity restated without interface change"
        - "implicit ledgers (Λ residues) carried across cycles"
      reversibility_window: >
        Formally open (“we can talk any time”), practically narrowed: repair windows exist in
        principle but become socially priced; later attempts are treated as re-opening settled
        matters, increasing Θ-costs.
    roles:
      - role_label: "Role A (higher exposure / burden carrier)"
        function: "participant who bears more downstream cost, cleanup, or obligation"
        exposure_profile: "Ω↑ (asymmetrically higher downstream cost)"
        notes: "Exposure persists despite parity claims; faces higher cost for raising Χ/repair."
      - role_label: "Role B (lower exposure / parity enforcer by frame)"
        function: "participant who benefits from flattened parity framing"
        exposure_profile: "Ω↓ (asymmetrically lower downstream cost)"
        notes: "May not intend exploitation; structurally benefits from parity-as-axiom frame."
      - role_label: "Optional: Audience / institution / metrics layer"
        function: "amplifies comparison/standing logic; rewards harmony display"
        exposure_profile: "low direct cost, high amplification power"
        notes: "Can harden □ drift and stabilize Α scripts without carrying Ω-consequences."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Observable differences persist between (a) declared parity and (b) actual exposure,
      outcomes, obligations, or repair labor distribution.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Closure pressure to maintain harmony and avoid conflict by affirming equality; counter-
      impulse to name the functional gradient when costs become salient.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "expected coordination / repair conversation does not occur (Λ persists)"
      - "acknowledgment of asymmetry is postponed or reframed as illegitimate"
      - "concrete interface change does not occur (Σ absent) while parity is reaffirmed"
      - "questions/verification are not treated as normal repair (Χ priced)"

  operator_mapping:
    operator_chain: ["Ψ", "Σ", "Χ", "Φ", "Θ", "Ω", "Α", "Λ", "□", "∇", "Δ"]
    reduced_signature: >
      PS = □(comparison/value-relation; parity-as-axiom) + Ω(real gradients)
           with Χ priced, Σ blocked/simulated, and Ψ misbound to appearance-management
           (typical companions: Φ narrative repair, Λ retained residues, Α protocol scripts across Θ).
    operator_notes:
      delta_difference: >
        Δ remains present as real differences in exposure/outcomes, but is re-described as “the same”
        inside □; Δ becomes unspeakable as functional gradient content.
      impulse_nabla: >
        ∇ closure pressure favors harmony performance; gradient-naming impulse is treated as threat.
      frame_box: >
        □ enforces value-relation: parity language functions as legitimacy/standing grammar.
        Gradient talk is treated as “unfair,” “accusatory,” or “disloyal.”
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ (missing repair, missing acknowledgment) remains active as open remainder; it can be denied
        (“nothing happened”) or retained as tension/lever surface without conversion into Σ.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Α stabilizes a repeatable script: parity assertion → reframing → surface reset → recurrence.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Ω remains fully operative in consequences/exposure/obligations; the key move is Ω-illegibility
        inside □ (Ω cannot be named as a coordinative gradient).
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ accumulates unresolved discrepancies; later repair becomes more expensive and less effective.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ supplies narrative repairs to restate parity and recode gradient talk as relational defect,
        without producing interface change.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ is available only defensively; reflective interruption/verification is socially priced
        (treated as aggression or relational rupture).
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ is bypassed or simulated: talk/ritual substitutes for durable role/load/interface adjustment.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ binds to maintaining parity appearance (“we’re equal / we’re fine”) rather than to
        coordinative commitments under named Ω (Ψ→Self to carry repair/interface obligations).
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signature uses “Χ priced / Σ blocked / Ψ misbound” as availability claims. PMS dependencies
      remain authoritative (e.g., Χ presupposes Φ/Θ/□). Reduced signatures are shorthand, not operator redefinitions.

        title: "Pseudo-Symmetry — core"
        formula: "□comparison + Ω real + Σ low/blocked + Ψ misbound (Χ priced; Φ/Λ/Α companions)"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Parity is asserted in □ while real Ω governs outcomes. Integration is displaced and binding
          attaches to appearance-management rather than coordination.
      - signature_id: "meta_signature_self_control_over_other_control"
        title: "Meta-signature: self-control > other-control"
        formula: "META = (Ψ ∘ Χ) applied to Ω-handling (D constraint) > Ψ→Other demands"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          PS drift often produces pressure instruments (“stop bringing it up / accept parity”) rather
          than self-bound commitments to adjust interfaces under real gradients.
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "PS"
        label: "Pseudo-Symmetry regime"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Ω is denied as speakable while still structuring consequences; coordination is replaced by
          parity maintenance.
      - drift_id: "P-Σ-SIM"
        label: "Σ-Simulation instead of Integration"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Agreements, apologies, or parity rituals occur without interface change; the same mismatch returns.
      - drift_id: "P-Λ-DN"
        label: "Λ → Denial / Suppression (“Nothing happened”)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Non-closure is minimized to preserve harmony; residue persists across Θ.
      - drift_id: "P-Ψ-EXT"
        label: "Ψ → Externalization (“You must…”)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Parity talk can become an obligation lever (“you must accept it’s equal”), shifting binding
          onto the other rather than carrying commitments as Ψ→Self.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      EDEN makes explicit that “we’re equal” can function as a regime-level substitute for reciprocity:
      parity language becomes the stabilizer while Σ/Ψ carriers remain weak under real Ω across Θ.

  drift_classification:
    drift_present: true
    drift_label: "Pseudo-Symmetry (parity-as-axiom under comparison-□)"
    minimal_drift_signature: >
      □(comparison/value-relation) + Ω(real gradients) across Θ,
      with Χ priced, Σ absent/simulated, Ψ bound to appearance-management; Φ repairs, Λ retained, Α stabilizes scripts.
    observable_markers:
      - "asymmetry talk punished, reframed, or treated as illegitimate"
      - "repeated parity affirmations without durable interface change"
      - "questions/verification treated as betrayal (Χ socially priced)"
      - "narrative repairs (Φ) substitute for coordination (Σ)"
      - "recurrence script becomes default (Α loop); non-closures persist (Λ)"

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Higher-exposure role bears more downstream cost (repair labor, cleanup, risk). Lower-exposure role benefits
      from friction reduction and can maintain parity framing at lower immediate cost.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Each cycle compounds: unresolved discrepancies harden into trajectories; later repair requires more effort
      and carries higher standing risk.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Open residues (missing acknowledgment/repair) persist as active remainder: they steer behavior, fuel recurring
      tension, and can become leverage surfaces inside a comparison frame.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "maintaining surface harmony to reduce immediate conflict cost"
      - "using parity language to avoid explicit obligation negotiation"
      - "using Φ narrative repair when Σ-work is costly or socially punished"
      - "withdrawing effort or increasing private monitoring when exposure becomes too costly"
    viability_moves_descriptive_not_prescriptive:
      - "Restore Ω speakability as functional gradients (not verdicts): name cost/exposure as coordinates."
      - "Protect Χ as a repair function: allow pause/verify/clarify without shaming."
      - "Convert one Λ residue into one Σ interface move (role/load/boundary/checkpoint adjustment)."
      - "Shift binding from parity-appearance to carried commitments (Ψ→Self), keeping reversibility real."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Parity language used to silence, shame, or humiliate attempts to name functional asymmetry (Ω).
    structural_indicator: >
      Χ becomes punished, Σ is simulated, and Ψ binds to appearance control (or externalizes obligations),
      increasing degradation risk under Ω.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "no diagnosis of persons, traits, or intentions"
      - "no moral evaluation of equality claims"
      - "no claim that the lower-exposure role is acting in bad faith"
      - "no global person labels (trustworthy/untrustworthy; good/bad)"
    claimed:
      - "structural description of a relational regime (frame + gradient + carrier failures)"
      - "cost-and-viability geometry under Ω/Θ with Σ/Ψ displacement"
    misuse_warning: >
      Treating this mapping as proof of bad faith, as authority for enforcement, or as a justification for
      humiliation/exclusion is misuse. Keep readings scene-bound, revisable, and dignity-constrained.

  structural_closure: >
    Pseudo-symmetry is a structural regime where parity language inside a comparison-dominant □ substitutes
    for reciprocity: real Ω gradients remain operative in consequences, but Ω is not coordinatively speakable.
    Σ integration is blocked or simulated, and Ψ binds to appearance-management rather than to carried commitments.
    Over Θ, Λ residues accumulate and Α stabilizes scripts, yielding predictable recurrence and erosion risk.

  plain_language_summary: >
    This case describes situations where people keep saying “we’re equal,” but the real burdens and risks are not
    equal. Because naming the imbalance is treated as illegitimate, the group/relationship doesn’t make concrete
    adjustments. Instead, it stays stable through repeatable scripts and explanations. Over time, the unresolved
    leftovers pile up and real cooperation becomes harder.
