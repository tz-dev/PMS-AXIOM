    assumptions_and_inferences: |
      - This is a structural pattern reading (not a concrete real-person case).
      - MIPractice A/C/R/P are applied to enactments/roles inside discourse and institutional settings.
      - Any scoring is banded and role-dependent; no person-level attribution is intended.

  snapshot:
    short_case_description: |
      A coherent explanatory system is treated as final closure: challenges are reframed as illegitimate,
      and remainder is denied rather than carried. Over time, boundary cases accumulate and revision becomes costly.

      - "Challenger / boundary-case introducer"
      - "Audience / downstream users"
      - "Gatekeeper (optional)"
    guiding_question: |
      Under what conditions does integration-for-coordination drift into integration-as-final-authority,
      and what structural protections keep inquiry revisable without collapsing into paralysis?

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: |
      - Inquiry requires frames: what counts as evidence, relevance, admissible questions.
      - Coordination demands some integration (coherence) for action and shared reference.
      - Institutions tend to stabilize canons and procedures over time.
    variable_elements: |
      - How scope is declared and enforced (explicit vs implicit).
      - Whether remainder is treated as open boundary vs error.
      - Whether contest channels are practically usable (forum access, dissent norms, review processes).
      - Whether updates are allowed via new contexts (recontextualization) and explicit revision rules.
    unfair_high_M_zones: |
      - Challengers with low formal access or high retaliation risk.
      - Downstream audiences subject to policy lock-in created elsewhere.
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: |
      - "We must be coherent" used to deny legitimate uncertainty or to block revision rights.
      - "Institutional constraints" used to justify permanent closure even when revision processes could exist.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: |
        The system-integrator often possesses strong internal knowledge of the framework,
        but may treat frame assumptions as invisible or self-evident.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: |
        Boundary cases, anomalies, cross-domain shifts, and downstream mismatch signals
        are available as warning inputs (when channels exist).
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: |
        Role confusion between "coordinator of meaning" and "final authority";
        blindness to scope limits and to the difference between coherence and warrant.

    coherence:
      official_narratives: |
        "The system is complete / settled / universally applicable; dissent indicates misunderstanding."
      visible_enactments: |
        Stock refutations; delegitimization of questions; ad hoc patches without scope revision;
        repetition of conclusions as substitute for reflective distance.
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: |
        High internal coherence can coexist with breaks in external coherence:
        the system claims universal reach while practice shows boundary policing and exception handling.

    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: |
        - When to declare scope limits.
        - When to acknowledge remainder and open revision.
        - When to allow contest channels and protect dissent.
        - When institutional lock-in is created (curricula, policy, gatekeeping).
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: |
        Tendency (in drift form) to shift revision costs onto challengers and downstream users;
        responsibility is redefined as loyalty to coherence rather than stewardship of revision.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: |
        Brittleness under time: accumulated anomalies surface as crises; downstream actors bear costs of mismatch.

    power:
      formal_power_distribution: |
        Gatekeepers/institutions often hold formal authority over inclusion, certification, and legitimacy.
      factual_power_distribution: |
        Narrative control and agenda-setting can suppress contestability even without explicit rules.
      used_alternatives: |
        - Strong boundary policing
        - Legitimacy control ("settled because decided")
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: |
        - Explicit scoping and revision rights
        - Protected dissent spaces
        - Review windows and structured update pathways

    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: |
        D module remains OFF. Dignity risks are handled via structural language hygiene
        (no person devaluation; focus on practices and roles).

    course_in_words: |
      The trajectory tends to move from workable coordination to closure posture when
      dissent becomes costly and scope is treated as universal. Over time, new contexts
      accumulate; if revision channels are blocked, the system becomes brittle and
      shifts from gradual updating to crisis correction.
    responsibility_viability_range: |
      Viability increases when scope, remainder, and revision rights are explicit; it collapses when
      authority substitutes for boundary discipline and reversibility is priced out.

    distortion_risks: |
      - Conflating strong integration with totalization; missing healthy high-Σ practices.
      - Over-reading the described drift as universal rather than conditional.

  biases_case_level:
    initial_intuition: |
      This pattern feels like "coherence used as authority" and thus likely to suppress revision,
      but the intuition must be checked against scope declarations, contestability, and actual update pathways.

      - "hindsight_bias"

      - "halo_effect"
    counter_reading_outline: |
      Counter-reading: some domains legitimately require high closure for coordination (safety-critical operations,
      legal compliance), and strong coherence can be protective if scope is explicit and revision channels exist.
      The decisive variable is not coherence itself but boundary discipline (scope + remainder + revisability).

  analyst_reflection:
    self_implication_notes: |
      Any analysis of dogmatism risks becoming a rhetorical weapon. This file therefore treats the phenomenon
      as a structural drift condition and foregrounds revision rights and scope hygiene rather than "who is wrong."
    possible_next_steps: |
      - Convert the protections into an institutional design checklist (scope statement, review windows, dissent protections).
      - If a concrete case is provided, re-run with explicit materials and role-specific M-bands.

  uniform_report:
    title: "Praxeological analysis of a practice pattern: Σ-totalization (dogmatism)"
    one_paragraph_overview: |
      This reading describes a structural drift in which a coherent explanatory system is treated as final closure.
      Instead of naming scope limits and carrying unresolved remainder, challenges are reframed as illegitimate,
      and revision channels become costly or unavailable. Over time, new contexts and boundary cases accumulate,
      making the system brittle: corrections happen mainly through crisis rather than steady updating. The key
      protection is not “less coherence,” but explicit scope, open remainder handling, and practical correction rights.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Coherence can coordinate action, but becomes risky when treated as sufficient authority without explicit scope."
      - "Where contest channels are priced out, asymmetry becomes structurally problematic (low transparency, not time-bounded, not reversible)."
      - "Revision stewardship is a responsibility function of those who control frames, certification, and institutional lock-in."
      - "Stable protections are explicit scope statements, review windows, and low-retaliation correction pathways."
    maturity_summary: |
      The enactment pattern shows mixed maturity: strong internal integration but weakened scope discipline and revision stewardship when closure becomes authority.
    ia_box_summary: |
      The asymmetry is structurally problematic when the setting suppresses transparency, time-boundedness, and reversibility of challenges and corrections.
    dignity_summary: ""
    trajectory_summary: |
      The pattern tends to move from coordination to closure posture and then into brittleness as new contexts accumulate; where revision channels exist, the trajectory can reverse without crisis.
    open_questions_summary: |
      Key uncertainties are domain scope, the real costs of dissent, and the presence or absence of functioning update pathways.
    conclusion: |
      In sum, the model suggests that the main failure is not integration itself but converting integration into final authority. For practice design,
      keep scope explicit, preserve remainder as a legitimate boundary, and ensure correction rights stay usable over time.
