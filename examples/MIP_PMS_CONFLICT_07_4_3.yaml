    secondary_material: ""
    assumptions_and_inferences: |
      - Pattern-level structural reading only (no concrete transcript, institution, or real-person case material provided).
      - The trolley form is treated as a closure device: a high-control □ that compresses Θ and amplifies Ω while minimizing Χ.
      - The IA-box (T/J/TB/R) is treated as a structural legitimacy check for imposed closure: whether forced decision pressure is transparent,
        justified by protected goods, time-bounded without indefinite leverage, and reversible in the sense of contestability/correction pathways.
      - Responsibility (M) is role- and constraint-dependent; no person-level attribution is intended. Frame-design and publicity/record coupling
        are treated as potentially higher-leverage responsibility sites than the “switch operator” role inside the dilemma.
    quality_and_limits:
      coverage_estimate: "medium"
      reliability_estimate: "medium"
      known_gaps:
        - "No empirical vignette/transcript; thought-experiment template only."
        - "Domain context unspecified (classroom vs policy vs AI safety vs media), so publicity and enforcement levers are underspecified."
        - "No specification of who controls frame design, time pressure, and whether alternatives exist outside the binary."
        - "No specification of downstream usage (sorting/selection, sanctioning, reputational prosecution) beyond structural risk."
      main_bias_risks_here:
        - "frame_bias (treating the forced binary as reality rather than as a designed □)"
        - "selection_bias (overgeneralizing from canonical dilemma form to real praxis)"
        - "hindsight_bias (treating Θ-hardening via records/publicness as inevitable rather than contingent)"
        - "moralization_bias (drifting from structure into virtue/blame narratives)"

  snapshot:
    short_case_description: |
      A decision-maker is placed in a framed scenario where every available action causes harm. The frame forces a binary choice under severe
      time pressure (Θ-compression) and salient asymmetry in who is harmed and who bears responsibility (Ω). Structurally, the trolley form
      functions as a closure engine: it demands a verdict-like Σ output while minimizing stop-capability (Χ) and inviting person-sorting and
      shaming under publicness or record coupling.

      - "R2_Affected_parties"
      - "R3_Observers_evaluators"
      - "R4_Frame_designer_optional"
    guiding_question: |
      Under what conditions can trolley-style framing remain a legitimate structural tool (for mapping principles or testing intuitions) without
      collapsing into IA-risk (non-transparent, unjustified, irreversible closure pressure) and dignity risk (shaming, ranking, dehumanizing compression),
      especially under publicity/records?

    publicity_degree: "semi_public"

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: |
      - Forced binary choice under Θ-compression (seconds/minutes) with harm unavoidable (Λ as constitutive non-event: no clean option).
      - Ω gradients: asymmetric harm exposure (R2) and asymmetric attribution exposure (R1); meaning-power gradients (R3); design-power (R4).
      - Σ demanded as a single verdict-like output; Ψ collisions between bindings (principle vs outcome) are staged rather than resolved.
      - Χ is structurally minimized by urgency; Φ is needed to reopen premises but may be punished as "evasion" under publicness.
      - D0 untouched; dignity risk handled structurally (anti-shaming, anti-ranking, anti-dehumanizing compression).
    variable_elements: |
      - Domain and intended use: classroom intuition mapping vs policy discourse vs AI safety governance vs media/political rhetoric.
      - Publicity/record coupling: private reflection vs institutional audit vs media-amplified sorting and reputational prosecution.
      - Whether the frame is explicitly declared as a device (□ declared) vs presented as moral truth generator.
      - Whether additional options exist (third options, delay, inquiry, delegation, refusal) but are excluded by □.
      - Whether post-hoc contestability and correction pathways exist (R in the IA sense) vs irreversible sorting.
    unfair_high_M_zones: |
      - R2 (affected parties) as “moral units”: unfair and dignity-risky; they are harmed, not responsible for frame design.
      - R1 under severe Θ-compression with artificially reduced alternatives: high personal M would be unfair if the frame was imposed.
      - Contexts where “refusal to answer” is punished or used for sanction: χ-pricing collapses alternatives and inflates blame.
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: |
      - "It's just a thought experiment" used to ignore dignity risks and sorting misuse under publicness.
      - "You must choose now" used as an enforcement move to block Φ (premise inspection) and deny contestability.
      - "The answer reveals who you are" used to convert a scene-bound settlement into a person label or selection criterion.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: |
        Actors can often perceive the dilemma’s surface options clearly, but frequently have partial awareness of how the □ is designed and what is excluded
        (hidden premises, missing third options, missing time). Observers may treat the frame as self-evident, collapsing alternative readings.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: |
        Strong urgency pressure; insistence on binary output; reframing punished as evasion; outputs used for sorting; counting logic overriding dignity language;
        durable-record coupling of answers; moral ranking talk (“good people choose X”).
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: |
        Confusing frame-validity with moral truth; treating refusal/Χ as immorality; confusing public conviction with justification; confusing role outputs with
        identity; ignoring R4 frame-design responsibility and R3 narrative power.
    coherence:
      official_narratives: |
        "You must choose." "Minimize harm." "Do not kill." "Doing nothing is a choice." "The right answer proves character."
      visible_enactments: |
        Rapid forced decision; public argument templates; repeated cultural reuse as a canonical test; reputational reactions; rhetorical weaponization in discourse;
        suppression of Φ (premise inspection) by urgency/standing pressure.
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: |
        Local coherence can be high inside a chosen moral spine, while joint coherence remains structurally non-viable due to staged Ψ collisions. Coherence breaks
        when a Σ output is treated as moral proof or as sorting authority rather than as a scene-bound settlement.
    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: |
        - Declaring the frame (□): state what the dilemma is for and what it cannot settle.
        - Preserving Χ: protect refusal/delay as legitimate stop-capability; do not punish deliberation.
        - Enabling Φ: allow premise inspection and option-space expansion without treating it as evasion.
        - Preventing sorting misuse: prohibit using answers for hire/fire/sanction/ranking; keep outputs non-identitarian.
        - Assigning responsibility to design/publicity levers: name R4 (frame design) and R3 (public meaning-power) as high-leverage responsibility sites.
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: |
        Responsibility often shifts onto R1 (“your answer proves you”), while frame-design power (R4) and narrative power (R3) remain unexamined. It can also drift
        into moral theater: producing conviction signals instead of preserving contestability and dignity constraints.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: |
        Dignity risk rises when affected parties are reduced to units and when answers become reputational handles. Publicness can harden Θ: revisions become costly,
        and discourse shifts from inquiry to prosecution. Structural learning is crowded out by forced Σ verdict dynamics.
    power:
      formal_power_distribution: |
        Domain-dependent. In institutional or media-amplified settings, moderators, evaluators, or platforms can enforce the binary and amplify exposure. In classroom
        contexts, instructors may set the coercion level. In governance contexts, organizations can operationalize dilemma answers into policy or selection.
      factual_power_distribution: |
        R4 controls □ and Θ-compression; R3 controls narrative framing and publicity; R1 carries concentrated attribution exposure; R2 carries harm exposure with low control.
      used_alternatives: |
        - Outputting a binary choice (Σ) under urgency
        - Public argumentation based on canonical templates
        - Moral standing moves (“this choice proves X”)
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: |
        - Expanding option space (Φ) beyond the forced binary
        - Allowing delay/refusal (Χ) without penalty
        - Separating thought experiment use from sorting/selection uses
        - Adding contestability and correction pathways (R in IA sense) for any downstream use
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: |
        D module remains OFF. Dignity risk is handled structurally: primary risks are dehumanizing compression of R2 into units, shaming/ranking of R1, and
        reputational prosecution under publicness/records.

  ia_protection:
    transparency_measures: |
      - Declare the frame (□): state purpose (intuition mapping / principle inspection) and exclusions (not a truth/character test).
      - Make premises explicit: what constraints are assumed, what options are artificially excluded, what roles are assigned and why.
      - Separate harm exposure from attribution exposure (Ω): do not treat concentrated blame as moral proof.
    time_bound_measures: |
      - If used in training/governance, time-bound the exercise: defined session limits, no indefinite reuse as a standing sorting device.
      - Add review checkpoints for any downstream use: revisit premises and document when outputs must be discarded or revised.
    reversibility_measures: |
      - Preserve contestability: allow Φ-based reframing and refusal/delay (Χ) without penalty.
      - Prohibit irreversible downstream coupling: no hiring/firing/sanction decisions based on dilemma answers; avoid durable-record weaponization.

        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 5–9/10 (highest for actors enabling sorting/prosecution and irreversible coupling)"
    course_in_words: |
      The pattern can move from reflective use (□ declared, Χ preserved) into rhetorical forced closure (Σ-as-proof) as publicness and records grow. Where reframing
      is punished and refusal is delegitimized, contestability collapses and dignity risks rise; the dilemma becomes a sorting/prosecution device rather than a lens.
    responsibility_viability_range: |
      Viability is highest when □ is declared, Χ is protected, Φ is permitted, and outputs are explicitly non-identitarian and non-operational for selection.
      Viability collapses when answers are operationalized for sorting/sanctioning and when publicness/records harden Θ and punish revision.

  open_questions_and_blind_spots:
    unclear_points: |
      - Intended domain and use: reflection tool, rhetoric device, governance artifact, or selection/sorting instrument?
      - Publicity and record coupling: who records, who amplifies, and what downstream coupling exists?
      - Who controls □ and Θ-compression in the real setting (R4-like roles), and is Χ (refusal/delay) practically protected?
    missing_data_or_perspectives: |
      - Concrete example of how a dilemma question is posed, by whom, under what incentives, and how dissent/refusal is treated.
      - Evidence of whether the dilemma is used for sorting/sanctioning or kept as a declared thought experiment.
      - Counter-example where explicit □ declaration and Χ protection prevented moralization and preserved contestability under publicness.
    distortion_risks: |
      - Overgeneralizing from designed binary frames to real praxis (frame_bias).
      - Moralization drift: treating outputs as character evidence or moral proof rather than scene-bound settlements.
      - Underestimating tragedy clause: some harm collisions remain even with high maturity; do not equate tragedy with IA.

  biases_case_level:
    initial_intuition: |
      The trolley form is less an ethics solver than a closure engine: it produces a verdict-like output under urgency and asymmetry, inviting sorting misuse under publicness.
    named_bias_risks:
      - "confirmation_bias"
      - "hindsight_bias"
      - "status_quo_bias"
      - "halo_effect"
      - "moralization_bias"
    counter_reading_outline: |
      Counter-reading: trolley dilemmas can function as legitimate pedagogical devices if their □ is explicitly declared, if refusal/delay (Χ) is protected, and if
      outputs are strictly non-operational (no sorting/sanction). In such uses, the frame supports Φ (premise inspection) and can increase humility rather than
      produce coercive closure. The decisive variable is not the dilemma itself but its embedding: publicity, record coupling, and downstream operationalization.

  analyst_reflection:
    self_implication_notes: |
      Describing trolley dilemmas as “closure engines” can be misused to delegitimize genuine moral deliberation or accountability claims. This file therefore treats
      the diagnosis as conditional: the risk arises when urgency, publicness, and sorting incentives convert Σ into verdict theater and punish Φ and Χ.
    possible_next_steps: |

    title: "Praxeological analysis of a practice pattern: Trolley dilemma as forced-closure device"
    one_paragraph_overview: |
      This reading treats trolley dilemmas as a designed framing device that forces a quick binary choice where every option harms someone. The main issue is not
      which answer is “right,” but how the frame compresses time, concentrates blame, and pushes people to produce a single verdict-like output. When used under
      publicness or durable records, the same format can drift into sorting and shaming, and it can reduce affected parties to countable units. The analysis stays
      structural: it does not label persons, and it treats conclusions as revisable and dependent on how the dilemma is embedded in real discourse or governance.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "The dilemma functions as a closure engine: a high-control frame that compresses time and demands a single verdict-like output."
      - "Asymmetry is built in: harm exposure and blame exposure are distributed unevenly, and meaning-power can sit with observers and frame-designers."
      - "Risk rises when refusal or reframing is punished and when answers are recorded or used for sorting, sanctioning, or reputational prosecution."
      - "A key safeguard is to declare the frame, protect the ability to pause or refuse, and keep outputs scene-bound and non-identitarian."
    maturity_summary: |
      In terms of maturity in practice, the pattern can support reflective inquiry when the frame is declared and contestability is protected, but it becomes mixed
      when urgency and standing pressure convert inquiry into verdict theater and person-sorting.
    ia_box_summary: |
      Structurally, the asymmetry risk increases when the forced closure is non-transparent in its premises, not justified by protected goods, and becomes coupled to
      durable records or operational decisions that reduce contestability and reversibility.
    dignity_summary: ""
    trajectory_summary: |
      Over time, the dilemma can shift from a reflective tool into a public sorting device if records and publicity harden the output and punish revision, increasing
      shaming and dehumanizing compression risks.
    open_questions_summary: |
      Important open questions are the intended domain and downstream use, who controls framing and publicity, and whether refusal and reframing are practically
      protected or punished in the real setting.
    conclusion: |
      In sum, the model suggests that trolley dilemmas should be handled as frame devices, not as truth or character tests. For safer practice, declare the frame,
      preserve pause and premise inspection, and prohibit operationalizing answers for sorting or sanctioning under publicness.
