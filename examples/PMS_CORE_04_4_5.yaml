    context: >
      A causal claim is demanded: an outcome is attributed to a prior event, agent action,
      policy, tool, or environmental condition. The dispute is not about lived experience
      but about how causal closure is produced, stabilized, and enforced within frames.
      PMS treats causality here as a structural attribution practice under constraints,
      not as a metaphysical guarantee about the world-in-itself.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Causality is scoped as responsibility-relevant or coordination-relevant attribution
        inside declared frames (□) (e.g., scientific explanation, legal liability, engineering
        root-cause analysis, social narration). Outputs are bounded: "within this frame,
        this attribution is structurally supported" vs "underdetermined (Λ)".
      protected_constraints:
        - "No metaphysical proof of causation is claimed"
        - "No person-level blame or intent inference is derived from causal language"
        - "Causal closure must declare frame (□), temporal grain (Θ), and asymmetry context (Ω) if relevant"
        - "Reversibility discipline applies: causal attributions are revisable under new framing (Φ) or new non-events (Λ)"
        - "Dignity-in-practice (D) constrains how causal attributions may be used under asymmetry"
      out_of_frame:
        - "Causation as an ontological substance or final metaphysical fact"
        - "Totalizing narratives: single-cause explanations that override declared frames"
        - "Psychological diagnosis, trait inference, or moral ranking via causal claims"
    temporality:
      time_scale: "event-to-outcome sequences and multi-step trajectories (Θ)"
      iteration_rhythm: "repeated attribution cycles: explain → test/contest → revise → restabilize"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "records, logs, and institutional memory that preserve causal stories (□/Θ)"
        - "repeatable patterns that function as causal heuristics (Α)"
        - "standards or doctrines that bind attribution practices over time (Σ→Ψ when formalized)"
      reversibility_window: >
        Causal assignments remain revisable while the frame permits alternative models (Φ),
        while evidence is incomplete (Λ), and while institutional binding has not fixed a doctrine (Ψ).
        When binding exists (e.g., legal precedent, safety standard), revision requires explicit
        re-integration (Σ) and re-authorization within the frame (□).
    roles:
      - role_label: "Attributor (explainer / analyst)"
        function: "Produces causal story sufficient for coordination, prediction, or accountability within a frame"
        exposure_profile: "Medium; exposed to contestation, evidence demands, and institutional constraints"
        notes: "Operates via □ selection, Θ ordering, and Σ integration; must preserve Λ residue when present."
      - role_label: "Affected party (exposed role)"
        function: "Bears consequences of the attribution (liability, repair burden, narrative positioning)"
        exposure_profile: "High; vulnerable to Ω-driven externalization and Ψ-hardening of causal claims"
        notes: "Not evaluated; treated as structurally exposed to causal closure regimes."
      - role_label: "Authority / standard-setter (institution, manager, court, committee)"
        function: "Can stabilize or enforce causal attributions as binding interpretations"
        exposure_profile: "High leverage, lower exposure; can externalize costs"
        notes: "Represents Ω gradients that can convert provisional stories into durable bindings (Ψ)."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      A salient contrast appears: outcome vs expected baseline, failure vs normal operation,
      harm vs no-harm, success vs near-miss. Δ sharpens "something changed" and invites attribution.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Strong closure demand: identify "the cause" to enable action, repair, blame-allocation,
      prediction, or narrative coherence. ∇ tends to compress multi-factor structures into a single driver.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "Expected evidence does not arrive (missing logs, absent witness, unrun test)."
      - "Expected intervention effect does not occur (fix applied but outcome persists)."
      - "Expected counterfactual clarity fails (cannot isolate variables within the frame)."

    reduced_signature: "PMS_CORE_CAUSALITY_Frame_Theta_Lambda_Alpha_Sigma_Psi"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        Causality is produced inside a declared □: what counts as evidence, admissible mechanisms,
        acceptable uncertainty, and decision thresholds are frame-dependent (science vs law vs engineering vs narrative).
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Causal attributions often operate under Ω: authorities can impose closure; affected parties bear costs.
        Ω gradients can convert explanatory convenience into enforced liability narratives.
      theta_temporality: >
        Causal structure is Θ-structured sequence/trajectory: ordering, lag, accumulation, and path dependence.
        "Cause" is typically a Θ-bridge between earlier configuration and later outcome, not a point property.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ appears as irreducible underdetermination (multiple sufficient explanations), missing evidence,
        non-reproducibility, or counterfactual opacity. PMS preserves Λ rather than laundering closure.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Α stabilizes causal heuristics: recurring patterns (failure modes, social scripts, institutional doctrines)
        become default explanations and can dominate even when Λ is high.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ shifts the causal question by embedding it in another frame: e.g., from "mechanism" (engineering)
        to "accountability" (law) to "meaning" (narrative). Φ often changes what counts as 'the cause'.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ integrates multi-factor accounts (contributing conditions, enabling constraints, triggers, pathways)
        into a coherent explanatory package compatible with the frame, without implying metaphysical finality.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ hardens an integrated causal account into policy, precedent, or identity-relevant commitment
        (e.g., standards, liability doctrines). Ψ is structurally expensive and requires Χ + reversibility discipline.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ prevents premature closure and coercive attribution: keeps causal stories revisable, scene-bound,
        and non-totalizing—especially important under Ω and high-stakes enforcement contexts.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Common hygiene failure: jumping from Δ/∇ directly to Ψ (binding blame/standards) without preserving Λ,
      tracking Φ, and performing Σ integration under Χ. Valid PMS application keeps causal closure frame-bound,
      revisable, and dignity-constrained.

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Authorities and institutions can impose a single causal story; affected parties may have limited contest capacity.
      Cost externalization often follows Ω: those with decision power bear less exposure than those living the consequences.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Once causal stories are recorded and operationalized (procedures, precedents, safety doctrines),
      they become sticky: revision requires time, coordination, and re-authorization; early closure creates path dependence.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Residue load consists of unobservable counterfactuals, confounded pathways, missing data, multi-causality,
      and disagreements across frames. Λ can remain high even when action must proceed.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Declare the frame (□) and decision purpose before asserting a causal claim."
      - "Prefer Θ-trajectory accounts over single-point causes when the process is extended or multi-step."
      - "Make Λ explicit (underdetermination, missing evidence) instead of forcing artificial closure."
      - "Track Φ when the causal question shifts (mechanism vs accountability vs meaning)."
      - "Use Σ to integrate contributing conditions rather than compressing into a single driver under ∇ pressure."
      - "Apply Χ to resist coercive or totalizing causal assignments under Ω; keep reversibility live unless Ψ is legitimate."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Causal language is used to impose coercive closure: converting provisional attribution into enforced blame,
      humiliation, or irreversible status claims, especially where Ω gradients reduce the subject's ability to contest.
    structural_indicator: >
      Ψ-hardening without Χ: a causal story becomes a binding verdict; Λ is suppressed; Φ shifts are ignored;
      alternative Σ-integrations are disallowed; costs are externalized down Ω gradients.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No metaphysical proof or theory of causation is provided."
      - "No single correct cause is guaranteed to be identifiable in complex scenes."
      - "No moral blame assignment is derived from causal attribution."
      - "No enforcement guidance for institutions is provided."
    claimed:
      - "Causal closure is modeled as a frame-bound (□) attribution practice stabilized by Α and Θ."
      - "Λ residues (missing evidence, underdetermination, counterfactual opacity) are preserved as structural outputs."
      - "Σ integrates multi-factor accounts; Ψ explains how causal stories become binding standards or precedents."
      - "Χ + reversibility + D constrain causal language under Ω."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use this case to weaponize causal attribution for blame, coercion, or irreversible labeling.
      Outputs are structural descriptions of how causal closure operates within frames, not verdicts about persons.

  structural_closure: >
    PMS reframes causality as a structural attribution configuration: Δ makes divergence legible, ∇ pressures closure,
    □ defines admissibility, Λ marks underdetermination and missing counterfactual access, Α stabilizes defaults,
    Θ orders trajectories, Φ shifts causal questions across frames, Σ integrates multi-factor accounts, and Ψ binds
    selected accounts into standards or precedents. Where closure exceeds what the frame can warrant, Λ remains.
    Output type: bounded causal-attribution map + explicit residue statement, not a metaphysical causation claim.

  plain_language_summary: >
    This case treats “cause” as something we construct to coordinate action and responsibility in specific contexts.
    We notice a difference, feel pressure to explain it, and then select a frame that decides what counts as evidence.
    Often the story can’t be fully settled—some uncertainty remains—and repeating patterns can make one explanation feel
    “obvious” even when it isn’t guaranteed. The aim is to keep causal claims explicit, revisable, and non-coercive,
    especially when power differences shape who bears the consequences of the explanation.
