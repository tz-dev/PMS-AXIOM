    context: >
      A classification conflict arises: multiple particulars are treated as "sharing the same kind"
      (e.g., redness, triangularity, justice, competence), and a closure demand appears for what
      secures sameness across instances. The case is treated as a structural problem of framing,
      stability, and reusability of classifications in praxis (not as an ontological dispute about entities).
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        The universals question is constrained to how sameness-of-kind is produced, stabilized,
        and transported across scenes within declared frames (□) for use in communication,
        coordination, and institutional practice. No metaphysical commitment to abstract objects is required.
      protected_constraints:
        - "No metaphysical entity-claims are required for closure at this level"
        - "Classification is treated as frame-relative (□) and praxis-stabilized (Α/Θ)"
        - "No person-ranking, diagnosis, or trait inference"
        - "Reversibility discipline applies to category assignments in applied contexts"
        - "Dignity-in-practice (D) constrains the use of categories under asymmetry (Ω)"
      out_of_frame:
        - "Universals as mind-independent entities (realism) or their denial (nominalism) as final verdicts"
        - "Psychological accounts of concept acquisition"
        - "Semantic theory as a substitute for structural mapping"
        - "Totalizing category regimes that override declared frames"

    temporality:
      time_scale: "multi-scene / multi-year stabilization of classification regimes (Θ)"
      iteration_rhythm: "repeated application → dispute → repair / update cycles"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "shared naming and repeated use across scenes (Α)"
        - "institutional codification and records (□/Ω-supported)"
        - "standards, templates, and exemplars that fix reuse (Α→Θ)"
      reversibility_window: >
        Category assignments remain revisable under frame shifts (Φ) and counterexamples (Λ),
        except where explicitly bound as operational standards (Σ/Ψ) under valid gates.

    roles:
      - role_label: "Classifier / user of kind-terms"
        function: "Applies categories for coordination and reference across scenes"
        exposure_profile: "Medium: errors propagate via reuse; costs depend on Ω context"
        notes: "Treated structurally as a role-function within frames, not as a cognitive subject."
      - role_label: "Counterexample provider / dispute role"
        function: "Produces Δ and Λ against an established kind-assignment"
        exposure_profile: "Variable; may face Ω costs when challenging institutional categories"
        notes: "A structural role that makes misfit legible; not an adversarial characterization."
      - role_label: "Institution / standard-setter (optional)"
        function: "Stabilizes category regimes as reusable artefacts (□→Α→Θ)"
        exposure_profile: "High leverage: can impose durable categories (Ω gradients)"
        notes: "Relevant when universals function as governance or policy primitives."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Differences between instances that still invite sameness claims (e.g., varying shades, contexts,
      or realizations) vs differences that break category membership.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Pressure to close classification: to treat multiple instances as "the same kind" for inference,
      prediction, coordination, and accountability; to reduce ambiguity and dispute costs.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "No agreed criterion arrives for borderline cases (Λ: missing rule, missing exemplar, missing test)."
      - "Expected stability of category membership fails across contexts (Λ: drift across frames)."
      - "Expected consensus on 'what makes it the same' does not occur (Λ: persistent underdetermination)."

    operator_chain: ["Ψ","Σ","Χ","Φ","Θ","Ω","Α","Λ","□","∇","Δ"]
    reduced_signature: "Δ ∘ ∇ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α ∘ Θ (→ Φ/Χ/Σ/Ψ when regimes are repaired or bound)"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        Universals are asked inside a frame (□): what counts as "same kind" is scoped by purposes
        (coordination, inference, institution) and by protected constraints.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Category regimes often sit inside Ω: some roles can impose definitions and enforcement
        costs (institutions, experts, gatekeepers), shaping which sameness claims survive.
      theta_temporality: >
        Kind-stability is a Θ property: repeated use over time stabilizes (or destabilizes) sameness
        through trajectories, records, and path dependence.
      lambda_residue: >
        Residue arises as borderline and underdetermined cases: no rule fully closes membership,
        and frame drift yields persistent Λ (missing consensus, missing criterion).
      attractor_alpha: >
        Repeated application forms an attractor (Α): "this counts as X" becomes habitual,
        teachable, and institutionally reproducible.
      recontext_phi: >
        New scenes reframe sameness (Φ): the same label is embedded in a new context,
        shifting admissible criteria and producing apparent universals conflicts.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ integrates multiple criteria (family resemblance, exemplars, rules, tests) into a workable
        classification regime; it remains frame-relative and revisable.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ appears when a regime is made commitment-bearing (standards, contracts, legal definitions):
        the category becomes a binding reference point across time.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ prevents category totalization: keeps classifications as artefacts within frames, not as essences,
        especially under Ω where categories can become coercive labels.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      PMS-only case: operator order remains canonical. The minimal structural core is □ with Δ/∇ plus Λ/Α/Θ
      for stabilization and underdetermination. Φ/Χ/Σ/Ψ are activated when category regimes are repaired,
      transported, integrated, or formally bound as standards.

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      When categories are institutionalized, Ω concentrates: standard-setters can externalize misfit costs
      to subjects and frontline roles. Dispute roles may carry retaliation or exclusion costs.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Once categories become records, standards, or legal definitions, Θ lock-in increases: early choices
      propagate and become expensive to revise; Σ updates face coordination costs.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Residue persists as borderline cases, context-sensitive realizations, and plural admissible criteria.
      Λ load increases when high-stakes decisions demand crisp boundaries that the frame cannot warrant.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Declare the operative frame (□) before asserting sameness-of-kind."
      - "Treat universals as stabilized classification artefacts (Α/Θ), not as forced entity claims."
      - "Keep Λ residue explicit for borderline cases (do not launder closure)."
      - "Use Φ to track when the same label has shifted frames (prevent equivocation)."
      - "Apply Χ to resist category totalization under Ω (no essence-by-label)."
      - "When required, integrate criteria via Σ and bind explicitly via Ψ (standards), keeping revision hooks."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Category regimes can become coercive labels under Ω: treating a practical kind-term as an essence,
      hardening it into exclusion, humiliation, or irreversible status assignment.
    structural_indicator: >
      Σ-totalization + Ψ-hardening without Χ: classifications treated as final, global, and non-revisable;
      Λ residues suppressed; frame boundaries ignored; imposed costs externalized to vulnerable roles.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No metaphysical verdict about the existence of universals is delivered."
      - "No semantic or psychological theory of concepts is assumed."
      - "No universal criterion for kind-identity across all frames is provided."
      - "No enforcement guidance for category regimes is given."
    claimed:
      - "Universals are re-described as a structural problem of category stabilization and transport across frames (□/Φ)."
      - "Stability arises via repeated use (Α) over time (Θ), with Λ residues for borderline/underdetermined cases."
      - "When categories become standards, Σ/Ψ explain integration and binding without metaphysical commitments."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use this case to justify essentialist labeling or irreversible status assignments.
      Categories here are frame-bound coordination artefacts, not truths about what things 'are' in themselves.

  structural_closure: >
    PMS delivers a bounded reframe: the universals problem is compiled as the stabilization and transport of
    sameness-of-kind across scenes. Within explicit frames (□), repeated use forms attractors (Α) and temporal
    stability (Θ), while borderline cases and frame shifts preserve Λ residues. Where regimes must be made
    operational, Σ integrates criteria and Ψ binds standards—without requiring metaphysical entity claims.
    Output type: taxonomy of stability modes and boundary statements delimiting where further closure is not
    structurally deliverable.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Instead of debating whether universals are real entities, this case treats “universals” as the practical
    problem of using the same category across many situations. Categories become stable through repeated use
    and institutional reinforcement, but there will always be borderline cases and context shifts where the
    label no longer fits cleanly. The point is to make frames and limits explicit, and to prevent categories
    from turning into coercive essences.
