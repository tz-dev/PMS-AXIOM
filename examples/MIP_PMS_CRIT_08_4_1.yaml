    assumptions_and_inferences: |
      - Pattern-level structural reading only (no concrete vignette, identifiable persons, or institution specified).
      - “Critique reach” is treated as a regime risk: micro evidence travels across scale without explicit □ boundary tracking.
      - IA box is used as a legitimacy screen for drift into authority laundering, exposure substitution, or irreversible reputational coupling.
      - Responsibility allocation (M) is leverage-dependent: higher where actors control amplification channels, records/publicness coupling, or governance uptake; lower where Χ is priced out after escalation.
    quality_and_limits:
      coverage_estimate: "medium"
      reliability_estimate: "medium"
      known_gaps:
        - "No concrete vignette/data; scenario remains template-level."
        - "Publicness level and record durability are not concretely specified (P overlay variable)."
        - "No concrete reach ladder (V0–V4) or scale ladder (a–d) instantiation provided beyond template claims."
        - "No protected-good justification for any downstream coercion/enforcement; analysis remains non-authorizing."
        - "No concrete redress/correction channels specified (complaints, audit rights, deletion/sunset rules)."

  snapshot:
    short_case_description: |
      A critique begins in a micro-context and is then reused to justify macro claims or to escalate public exposure.
      The central structural risk is reach laundering: micro evidence travels across scale without explicit □ boundary tracking,
      while Ω/Θ are amplified by records/publicness, shrinking Χ revision windows and substituting exposure for Σ correction.

      - "R2_local_target"
      - "R3_amplifier_or_reuser"
      - "R4_audience_or_governance_consumers"
    guiding_question: |
      How can micro→macro critique travel remain structurally legible and reversible (□/Χ under Ω/Θ), producing Σ-corridors and Ψ follow-up ownership,
      while preventing drift into authority laundering, judgment theater, or public pillory dynamics?

    publicity_degree: "variable"

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: |
      - Micro→macro travel: critique tokens move across contexts and scales.
      - Ω exposure gradients steepen with amplification; costs distribute unevenly.
      - Θ hardening via records/searchability/durable traces shrinks reversibility windows.
      - Χ (stop/revision rights) becomes priced once publicness overlay is activated.
      - Λ load accumulates when boundaries/follow-up/revision windows are missing, and absence becomes “evidence.”
    variable_elements: |
      - Publicness level (private/semi_public/institutional/public/media_amplified) and artifact durability.
      - Who controls amplification channels (platforms, institutions, group dynamics) and whether they can be audited.
      - Presence/absence of explicit □ reach policies (target-level declaration, permitted generalization steps).
      - Existence of Σ corridors (concrete corrective steps) vs exposure-only handling.
      - Ψ follow-up ownership design (who tracks corrections over time; how diffusion is prevented).
      - Rights for correction, right of reply, and record-sunset norms (Χ/Θ safeguards).
    unfair_high_M_zones: |
      - Where Χ is effectively unavailable after escalation (priced by publicness/records), high individual M attributions are structurally unfair.
      - Where actors have near-zero control over artifacts or amplification (platform dynamics), M remains limited; leverage holders carry more co-responsibility.
      - For R2 targets under P, blaming inability to “just clarify” ignores Θ/Ω amplification and priced revision windows.
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: |
      - “It’s public now, nothing can be done” asserted without mapping feasible mitigations (correction protocols, de-indexing, sunset rules).
      - “Critique must be loud to matter” asserted without testing Σ corridors or bounded reach options.
      - “The audience decides” used to launder authority and avoid Ψ follow-up ownership.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: |
        Actors may notice the felt shift when critique travels (“this now means something bigger”), but may miss the mechanism:
        how □ boundaries, records/publicness, and audience dynamics change Χ/Σ viability and steepen Ω.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: |
        Fast escalation pace; quoting/forwarding/screenshotting; “macro claims” from micro snippets; refusal of revision windows;
        “everyone can see” rhetoric; audience alignment scripts; governance uptake without stated criteria.
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: |
        Treating reach as legitimacy; collapsing mismatch analysis into person judgment; mistaking amplification for correction;
        confusing narrative persuasion (Φ) with actionable change (Σ); losing track of who owns follow-up (Ψ).
    coherence:
      official_narratives: |
        “This shows how the system is.” “If it’s true locally, it’s true generally.” “Exposure is accountability.”
        “Silence proves complicity.” “Publicness is necessary for justice.” “Rules are neutral.”
      visible_enactments: |
        Micro snippet reused across contexts; audience pile-on or silence scripts; process-talk loops; performative alignment;
        occasional corrections that do not reduce artifact durability; governance reactions that treat tokens as evidence.
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: |
        Coherence breaks when the narrative claims “correction” but practice delivers exposure without Σ corridors,
        or when “revisability” is proclaimed while revision (Χ) is penalized as evasion.
    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: |
        - Declare the unit (□): target-level, permitted generalization steps, and reach boundary before escalation.
        - Preserve revision rights (Χ): protect correction windows, right of reply, and non-penalized revision after escalation.
        - Demand Σ corridors: require actionable corrective steps; do not substitute exposure for correction.
        - Allocate responsibility by leverage: who can amplify, document, de-index, sunset, or operationalize tokens in governance.
        - Prevent downstream coupling: do not use critique tokens as sanction/selection logic without explicit IA-box justification.
        - Keep language dignity-safe: prohibit shaming/pillory scripts and person-level compression.
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: |
        Responsibility often diffuses with scale: many can amplify, few own Ψ follow-up. Conversely, responsibility is shifted onto targets
        (“just clarify”) despite priced Χ and Θ-hardening. Refusal appears as “the public will decide” or “platform dynamics” without mitigations.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: |
        Under Θ, durable traces persist beyond corrections; under Ω, exposure costs concentrate on targets/originators while amplifiers bear low cost.
        Third parties can be harmed by precedent: future critique becomes fear-driven, silence scripts stabilize, and trust in correction corridors erodes.
    power:
      formal_power_distribution: |
        Template-level: varies by embedding. Platforms/institutions may formalize documentation and governance uptake; audiences hold informal sanction power.
      factual_power_distribution: |
        Amplifiers and governance consumers can steepen Ω and harden Θ via artifacts; targets and originators may lose context control and Χ revision capacity.
      used_alternatives: |
        - Escalation to publicness as leverage.
        - Narrative recontextualization (Φ) to justify macro claims.
        - Process-talk or statements as symbolic action (sometimes without Σ).
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: |
        - Explicit reach policy (□) and bounded disclosure rules.
        - Time-bounded correction windows and right-of-reply protocols (Χ).
        - Record limitation/sunsets/de-indexing to preserve reversibility (Θ safeguards).
        - Assigning Ψ follow-up ownership (who tracks corrections across contexts).
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: |
        D module remains OFF. Dignity risk is handled structurally: the primary risk is public degradation via pillory dynamics,
        person-level compression, and irreversible attribution under amplified Ω/Θ when critique substitutes exposure for correction.

  ia_protection:
    transparency_measures: |
      - Declare the unit (□): state target-level (scene/role/practice/policy) and permitted generalization step before escalation.
      - Separate observation vs evaluation: document what happened locally vs what is inferred structurally; mark inferences explicitly.
      - Name amplification conditions: publicness level, artifact durability, platform/institutional coupling, and who controls reach.
      - Prohibit reach-as-legitimacy shortcuts: reach/scale are descriptive, not authority.
    time_bound_measures: |
      - Define time-bounded correction windows after escalation (right of reply; revision windows).
      - Add review checkpoints for governance uptake: re-evaluate claims after corrections and context additions.
      - Use sunset clauses for amplified tokens where feasible (expiry/de-indexing of outdated snippets).
    reversibility_measures: |
      - Provide correction mechanisms that can meaningfully update circulation (pinned corrections, de-indexing, retractions where possible).
      - Avoid irreversible downstream coupling: no sanction/selection logic derived from critique tokens alone.
      - Ensure interruption rights (Χ): allow pause/revision without treating it as evasion or guilt evidence.

        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 4–8/10 (highest where actors operationalize tokens for sanction/selection)"
    course_in_words: |
      The pattern moves from a micro mismatch toward cross-scale reuse, where publicness/records amplify Ω/Θ and shrink Χ revisability.
      Where □ boundaries, Σ corridors, and Ψ follow-up ownership are designed, critique can travel responsibly and remain corrigible.
      Where reach becomes legitimacy and exposure becomes action, drift stabilizes into judgment theater and durable reputational coupling.
    responsibility_viability_range: |
      Viability is highest when reach is explicitly bounded (□), revisions are protected (Χ), correction corridors exist (Σ), and follow-up is owned (Ψ) under time-bounded, reversible artifact governance.
      Viability collapses when escalation outruns correction design, when artifacts harden irreversibly, and when audience dynamics substitute for accountable action.

  open_questions_and_blind_spots:
    unclear_points: |
      - What is the concrete embedding (relationship/organization/platform/governance), and what is the actual publicness/record coupling?
      - What is the intended reach boundary (target-level) and what generalization step is permitted in this context?
      - Who controls amplification and artifact governance (posting, pinning corrections, de-indexing, deletion, institutional archiving)?
      - What correction/reply protocols exist, and are they time-bounded and reversible?
      - Is there a defined Ψ follow-up owner, or does accountability diffuse across scale?
    missing_data_or_perspectives: |
      - A concrete vignette describing the micro mismatch, the scale move, and the specific artifacts used (quotes/screenshots/posts).
      - Evidence about how corrections travel (or fail to travel) relative to the original token.
      - Perspectives of affected parties on what would count as fair reach and safe correction without exposure harm.
    distortion_risks: |
      - Overgeneralizing from the template to cases where reach is legitimately bounded and corrigible (abstraction_bias).
      - Treating publicness as inherently illegitimate or inherently necessary without protected-good justification.
      - Moralization drift: turning drift labels into condemnation tokens.
      - Missing alternative levers: assuming irreversibility without checking artifact governance options.

  biases_case_level:
    initial_intuition: |
      Critique reach names a common failure mode: micro mismatch gets reused as macro evidence, and publicness/records turn interpretation into durable exposure.
      The main risk is that critique becomes a sanction substitute (authority laundering) rather than a correction corridor.

    counter_reading_outline: |
      Counter-reading: some micro→macro moves are legitimate and necessary (e.g., when local repair is blocked or retaliation risk makes micro repair non-viable),
      and bounded public disclosure can be justified by protected goods. A safe application must map (i) target-level boundaries, (ii) correction corridors,
      and (iii) artifact governance before treating escalation as drift.

  analyst_reflection:
    self_implication_notes: |
      Reach language can become a weapon: it can be used to dismiss justified escalation, or it can be used to launder authority for exposure and sanction.
      This reading therefore stays system-bound, keeps IA-box undecidability explicit at template level, and requires bounded □/Χ/Σ/Ψ mapping before governance uptake.
    possible_next_steps: |
      - Add one concrete vignette and map: target-level, generalization step, publicness level, artifact type/durability, and correction pathways.
      - Specify reach policy (□) and disclosure rule set for the embedding (what may be escalated, under what conditions, with what safeguards).
      - Add explicit if/then criteria for when escalation is justified vs when it becomes exposure substitution (Σ absent; Χ priced; Ψ diffused).
      - Add an artifact governance checklist: right of reply, pinned corrections, de-indexing, sunset clauses, and anti-sanction coupling.

    title: "Praxeological analysis of a practice pattern: Critique reach as micro→macro travel under publicness/records"
    one_paragraph_overview: |
      This reading treats “critique reach” as a practice pattern where a local mismatch is reused to support larger claims or to escalate exposure.
      The key issue is not who is right, but whether the cross-scale move keeps boundaries explicit, allows revision, and produces an actionable correction step.
      When critique becomes public and durable records form, exposure gradients and time hardening rise quickly, and the ability to pause or revise shrinks.
      Without clear boundaries and follow-up ownership, critique language can drift into authority laundering, judgment theater, or public pillory dynamics.
      The analysis therefore keeps the unit structural and highlights reach policies and disclosure rules that preserve reversibility and dignity-safe communication.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Critique reach risk is modeled as micro→macro travel where □ boundaries, Χ revision rights, Σ correction corridors, and Ψ follow-up ownership can collapse under Ω/Θ amplification."
      - "Publicness/records steepen Ω and harden Θ, making corrections less able to unwind residue unless artifact governance safeguards exist."
      - "Drift risk rises when reach becomes legitimacy and exposure substitutes for correction (Σ absent; Χ priced; Ψ diffused)."
      - "Responsibility allocation is leverage-dependent: higher for amplifiers and governance consumers who operationalize tokens; lower where alternatives/revision are priced out."
      - "Misuse risk: drift labels are used as condemnation tokens or as excuses to dismiss justified escalation; keep counter-readings explicit."
    maturity_summary: |
      In terms of maturity in practice, the pattern supports adult enactment when critique stays boundary-tracked, corrigible, and action-oriented, rather than becoming exposure-driven closure.
    ia_box_summary: |
      Structurally, IA risk rises when cross-scale critique becomes non-transparent, unjustified, indefinite, or non-corrigible—especially under durable artifacts and punished revision attempts.
    dignity_summary: ""
    trajectory_summary: |
      Over time, the constellation tends to drift from a local mismatch toward scale-amplified exposure unless explicit reach boundaries, correction corridors, and follow-up ownership are preserved.
    open_questions_summary: |
      Important open questions are the concrete embedding, the actual publicness/record coupling, who controls amplification and artifact governance, and which correction/reply protocols exist.
    conclusion: |
      The model suggests using “critique reach” to keep scale moves legible and corrigible: declare the target-level, protect revision windows, require actionable correction steps, and assign follow-up ownership.
      For safer practice under publicness, add artifact governance safeguards (right of reply, pinned corrections, de-indexing, sunset rules) and prevent downstream coupling into sanctions or selection.
