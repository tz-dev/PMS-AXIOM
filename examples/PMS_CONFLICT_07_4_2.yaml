        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can represent distance (Χ), integration (Σ), binding (Ψ), asymmetry (Ω), and temporality (Θ),
          but it does not by itself formalize the CONFLICT-specific fork where (i) repair loops remain possible
          only while Χ is available and reversibility windows remain open, while (ii) escalation stabilizes as an
          attractor (Α_conflict) once Χ becomes priced/asymmetric and Φ drifts into substitution/exposure capture.
          The CONFLICT overlay supplies reduced signatures and drift classes that keep this fork legible without
          converting it into diagnosis, blame, or “solutions”.

  scene_packet:
    scene_id: "GENERIC_REPAIR_FORK_UNDER_CONFLICT"
    context: >
      A coupled relationship (dyad or group) repeatedly cycles between attempts at repair and episodes of escalation.
      Both parties remain engaged (Ψ>0), but the interaction oscillates: repair sometimes lands, sometimes fails,
      and escalation occasionally becomes self-sustaining via exposure, timing control, or narrative hardening.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        The scene is read as a structural fork: whether repair remains viable depends on the availability and price
        of distance (Χ), the openness of reversibility windows (Θ), and whether recontextualization (Φ) remains
        revisable rather than becoming an enforcement channel under exposure (Ω).
      protected_constraints:
        - "Scene-bound description only; no global labels (reversibility)."
        - "Χ must remain a real stop-capability (not delegitimized, punished, or asymmetrically priced)."
        - "D constrains language under Ω: no shaming, ranking, humiliation, or person-totalization."
        - "No conversion of descriptive CONFLICT language into governance authority or enforcement affordances."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Therapeutic or clinical inference; diagnosis; personality typing."
        - "Moral verdict production (virtue sorting, blame closure)."
        - "A stepwise repair or mediation method (procedure manual)."
        - "Public prosecution / reputational enforcement / selection-sorting."

    temporality:
      time_scale: "weeks–years (repeated cycles with accumulating residue)"
      iteration_rhythm: "episodes → attempted repair → partial reset → re-trigger"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "Durable records (messages, documents, third-party memory)"
        - "Shared obligations/projects/roles (Ψ continuity)"
        - "Path dependence: earlier framings constrain later moves (Θ hardening)"
        - "Recurrent non-events that accumulate as residue (Λ → Α)"
      reversibility_window: >
        Variable and typically shrinking: repair remains feasible while interpretations can be revised under Φ
        without penalty, and while Χ can be taken symmetrically. Windows narrow under publicness, record coupling,
        and asymmetric liability/exposure gradients (Ω + Θ).

        notes: "Presence increases misuse gradient (MG) and exposure capture risk."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Divergence in what counts as harm, obligation, concession, or relevance (□A ≠ □B), producing competing
      coherence spines (ΣA vs ΣB) even when both are internally articulate.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Closure pressure to settle and protect standing: defend, counter-accuse, demand acknowledgment, demand
      repair, or force a decision—amplified under exposure (Ω) and shrinking time windows (Θ).
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "Expected acknowledgment does not arrive (Λ becomes load-bearing)."
      - "Expected repair action is delayed or withheld (Λ → leverage channel under Ω/Θ)."
      - "Expected pause/timeout (Χ) is not granted symmetrically (Χ becomes contested/priced)."
      - "Expected clarification fails to reduce conflict (Φ does not reopen reversibility; instead hardens)."

    reduced_signature: >
      Fork marker: (repair viable) Χ + Φ(revisable) → Σ(shared) under Ψ
      versus (escalation) Α_conflict under Ω/Θ with priced/asymmetric Χ and Φ-substitution.
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        The fork is framed as a viability question: whether repair remains a live option depends on whether the
        scene still supports reversible Φ and usable Χ (pause/stop) without penalty.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Ω determines who can escalate cheaply, who is harmed by delay, who controls visibility, and whose “distance”
        is interpreted as defection. Ω often decides whether repair is even reachable.
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ converts episodes into trajectories: each failed repair attempt can increase lock-in, narrow options,
        and raise the cost of revision. Shrinking windows intensify ∇ toward forced settlement.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ accumulates as residue: missing acknowledgments, delayed repairs, and unclosed loops become structural
        material for later escalation (often misread as essence unless Θ-history is kept explicit).
      attractor_alpha: >
        Repetition stabilizes either (i) a repair attractor (predictable cooling + acknowledgment + revision),
        or (ii) an escalation attractor (predictable counter-moves + exposure amplification + hardening).
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ is the pivot: it can reopen a shared frame (bridge) or become substitution (narrative overwrite,
        scope creep, verdict-like interpretation) especially under exposure/publicness.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ can succeed locally while failing jointly. Repair requires enough shared Σ to coordinate next steps
        without forcing convergence on a single narrative.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ keeps the coupling active: obligations/identity commitments persist even when repair fails, creating
        a pressure cooker dynamic where “not engaging” is itself costly.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ is the decisive scarce resource: if pauses and reflection are delegitimized, punished, or asymmetrically
        available, escalation becomes structurally rational and repair corridors collapse.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signatures are shorthand only. PMS prerequisites remain authoritative:
      Χ presupposes Φ/Θ/□; Σ presupposes Χ/Φ; Ψ presupposes Σ/Θ/Χ. Any scene claiming
      “Σ without Χ” or “Ψ externalized as demand” indicates drift and is invalid as PMS application.

      - signature_id: "CONFLICT_stabilized_pattern"
        title: "Stabilized conflict attractor (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Α + Ω + Θ + Ψ + Χ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          The oscillation becomes legible as attractor competition: either repair stabilizes (repair-attractor),
          or escalation stabilizes (Α_conflict) once Χ becomes priced/asymmetric under Ω/Θ.
      - signature_id: "DRIFT_asymmetry_lock_in"
        title: "Asymmetry lock-in (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Ω + Θ + Χ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          If one role position can pause/withdraw/reframe cheaply while the other cannot, repair becomes structurally
          gated; escalation is reinforced by differential timing/visibility control.
      - signature_id: "DRIFT_exposure_capture"
        title: "Exposure capture (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Ω + Θ + Φ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Under audience coupling or durable records, reframing and clarification (Φ) drift into enforcement-like
          affordances; revision is punished and repair signals harden into prosecution material.
      - signature_id: "DRIFT_dignity_collapse"
        title: "Dignity collapse (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Ω + Θ + Χ + Ψ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Under repeated failure and pressure, language can drift into shaming/ranking, collapsing D and thereby
          converting repair attempts into further escalation fuel.

    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "asymmetry_lock_in_drift"
        label: "Asymmetry lock-in (Χ priced asymmetrically)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Repair requires symmetric stop-capability; if Χ is unevenly available or socially punished, escalation
          becomes the only viable “action corridor” for the higher-exposure role.
      - drift_id: "exposure_capture_drift"
        label: "Exposure capture (Φ under Ω/Θ with scaled publicness)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Escalation often routes through Φ under exposure: interpretations become durable verdicts; clarification
          expands the record and increases irreversible coupling.
      - drift_id: "dignity_collapse_drift"
        label: "Dignity collapse (D-constraint failure under Ω/Θ)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          When repair fails repeatedly, restraint loses binding force; person-totalization and ranking language
          appear as closure substitutes, accelerating escalation attractor stabilization.
      - drift_id: "binding_collision_drift"
        label: "Binding collision (Ψ-collision)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Persistent coupling (Ψ>0) can collide with incompatible commitments; repeated repair attempts then raise
          costs while failing to restore joint Σ, pushing the system toward escalation or terminal regime.

    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      The overlay explicitly models “repair vs escalation” as an attractor competition under cost gradients:
      repair corridors depend on usable Χ and revisable Φ, while escalation corridors expand when Χ is priced
      or asymmetric and Φ becomes substitution/exposure capture under Ω/Θ. This prevents misreading escalation
      as mere “lack of skill” and prevents misreading repair as guaranteed whenever Σ is attempted.

    observable_markers:
      - "Timeouts/pauses (Χ) are contested, punished, or unevenly available."
      - "Clarifications (Φ) increase exposure and harden positions rather than reopening revision."
      - "Non-events (Λ) accumulate and are recycled as leverage in later episodes."
      - "Repair attempts raise costs without increasing shared Σ viability (Θ hardening)."
      - "Language compresses into global claims, ranking, or humiliation (D stress)."

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Differential liability, reputational risk, or dependence shapes who can speak freely, who can delay,
      who can withdraw, and who pays the cost of continued coupling. Audience/institutional presence can
      amplify Ω by converting statements into durable consequences.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Each episode can increase path dependence: earlier framings constrain later options; “repair” becomes
      more expensive because revision windows close and record coupling grows. Attempts to force resolution
      under Θ often intensify escalation.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Missing acknowledgments, delayed repairs, and unresolved micro-breaches accumulate as residue; this
      residue becomes structurally load-bearing and can seed escalation attractors unless repair loops
      re-open revision capacity.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Repair-corridor behavior: narrowing claims to the immediate frame (□) to preserve reversibility."
      - "Repair-corridor behavior: taking distance (Χ) to reduce impulse fusion and reopen Φ revision."
      - "Repair-corridor behavior: integrating locally (Σ) without demanding total convergence on one narrative."
      - "Escalation-corridor behavior: increasing exposure to force settlement when Χ is unavailable or punished."
      - "Escalation-corridor behavior: hardening frames (□) and treating Φ as verdict production under Θ pressure."
      - "Both-corridor behavior: reallocating responsibility talk according to Ω gradients rather than pseudo-symmetry."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Under repeated failure, closure pressure converts into shaming/ranking, public prosecution, or coercive
      exposure—especially when one side controls visibility and the other bears liability (Ω).
    structural_indicator: >
      Χ is delegitimized; Φ becomes enforcement; Σ attempts are replaced by narrative prosecution; Ψ is externalized
      as imposed obligation; reversibility windows collapse under Θ.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No claim about motives, sincerity, pathology, or trait-level character."
      - "No prescription or stepwise repair method; no guaranteed intervention logic."
      - "No authorization for enforcement, sanction, or reputational action."
      - "No claim that escalation implies immaturity or that repair implies virtue."
    claimed:
      - "Escalation vs repair is structurally a fork governed by Ω/Θ cost gradients and Χ availability."
      - "Repair remains viable when Φ is revisable and Χ is usable without penalty; escalation stabilizes when not."
      - "Λ residue and Α stabilization explain why cycles repeat without essence-attribution."
      - "CONFLICT overlay keeps the analysis finite: legibility + boundaries, not solutions."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not convert this fork description into person labels (“the escalator”, “the mature one”), nor into
      governance authority. Under high publicness or durable records, Φ/Ω capture risk is high and application
      is structurally unsafe without explicit mode/publicness/misuse declarations.

  structural_closure: >
    The configuration is a repeated-cycle regime where repair and escalation compete as attractors. Repair requires
    real stop-capability (Χ), revisable reframing (Φ), and sufficient shared Σ to coordinate next steps without forced
    convergence. Escalation becomes structurally rational and self-stabilizing when Χ is priced/asymmetric under Ω,
    Θ hardens trajectories, Λ residue accumulates, and Φ drifts into substitution/exposure capture. The case closes
    by specifying the fork conditions and the guardrails that prevent moralization and coercive conversion.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Conflicts often alternate between “trying to fix it” and “making it worse.” Whether repair is possible depends
    less on good intentions and more on structural conditions: can both sides pause and reflect without penalty, can
    interpretations be revised without turning into public verdicts, and do past delays and missed acknowledgments
    keep piling up? When pauses are punished or unevenly available and everything becomes a durable record, escalation
    can become the stable pattern. This case describes that fork without blaming people or promising a solution.
