        why_this_addon: >
          PMS-core models commitment formation structurally (Θ lock-in, Ω exposure gradients,
          Σ integration, Ψ self-binding) but does not, by itself, formalize the ANTICIPATION
          boundary discipline that prevents commitment from drifting into prophecy/authority:
          Λ-collapse into certainty, Χ-erosion under urgency or validation, probability → action-compulsion,
          and Ψ-externalization ("others must comply") especially under institutional Ω. The ANTICIPATION
          overlay keeps Λ explicit under Θ and supplies invalidity markers for "certainty/authority laundering."

  scene_packet:
    scene_id: "IRREV_COMMIT_01"
    context: >
      A decision point requires commitment that creates durable consequences and shrinking exit options:
      contracts, irreversible allocations, public pledges, infrastructure build-outs, institutional gating,
      or role-binding promises. The scene concerns how a commitment is formed and justified under
      uncertainty (Λ) and time pressure (Θ), while costs and exposure are distributed unevenly (Ω).
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Commitment is treated as a frame-bound coordination structure: what is being bound, for how long,
        under which constraints, and with what revision/exit conditions (if any).
      protected_constraints:
        - "Irreversibility is a structural fact under Θ: lock-in accumulates and exit windows shrink."
        - "Uncertainty remains active (Λ persists): no event guarantees the future scenario that motivated the commitment."
        - "Recontextualization (Φ) remains structurally possible even if reversal is costly."
        - "Distance (Χ) is required: no fusion into urgency, verdict, or authority conversion."
        - "Integration (Σ) coordinates pressures/constraints without totalization."
        - "Dignity-in-practice (D) constrains handling of affected parties under Ω (no coercion, humiliation, status-hardening)."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Prophetic closure: treating the motivating forecast/story as settled future truth."
        - "Action mandates justified by probability rhetoric alone ('must commit because likely')."
        - "Governance/enforcement recipes; compliance engineering."
        - "Global person/group labels derived from (non-)commitment."
        - "Retroactive inevitability narratives that rewrite Λ away after outcomes."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "mid-to-long horizon (weeks to years), explicitly horizon-dependent"
      iteration_rhythm: "commitment point + downstream review cycles (if any)"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "sunk costs / capital allocation"
        - "public record / reputational traces"
        - "legal or institutional binding"
        - "infrastructure coupling / dependency chains"
        - "third-party reliance"
      reversibility_window: >
        Highest before externalization; shrinks as commitments harden into policy, infrastructure,
        public identity, or third-party reliance. Revision may remain possible via Φ, but reversal becomes
        structurally costly under Θ-lock-in.
    roles:
      - role_label: "R1: Committer / decision-holder"
        function: "forms and authorizes the binding move; integrates signals under □"
        exposure_profile: "may hold authority but can externalize costs; risk of Ω inflation via entitlement"
        notes: "analyzed structurally (position and constraints), not psychologically"
      - role_label: "R2: Counterparty / institution"
        function: "receives commitment benefits; can harden the frame and shrink reversibility"
        exposure_profile: "often asymmetric leverage; can convert commitment into enforceable status"
        notes: "may stabilize Α (routines) and intensify Θ lock-in"
      - role_label: "R3: Affected parties"
        function: "carry downstream consequences of the commitment"
        exposure_profile: "often highest downside and lowest exit options under Ω"
        notes: "primary D-risk location when commitment becomes coercive or status-hardening"
      - role_label: "R4: Implementers (optional)"
        function: "translate commitment into enacted steps and operational constraints (E downstream)"
        exposure_profile: "can be pressured by urgency narratives; may be punished for raising Φ signals"
        notes: "structurally relevant for drift detection (action-compulsion)"

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Reversible vs irreversible moves become legible: optionality vs lock-in, local adjustment vs global
      binding, bounded commitments vs totalizing identity/policy claims.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Closure pressure to decide and bind: fear of missing windows, desire for certainty/control, need for
      coordination legitimacy, and reputational pressure to appear decisive.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "No decisive warrant event arrives that guarantees the committed-to future trajectory."
      - "No final confirmation eliminates uncertainty for future contexts; regime shifts remain possible."
      - "Counterfactuals remain opaque (what would have happened without committing)."
      - "Feedback may be delayed or absent; early indicators can mislead."

  operator_mapping:
    operator_chain: ["Ψ", "Σ", "Χ", "Φ", "Θ", "Ω", "Α", "Λ", "□", "∇", "Δ"]
    reduced_signature: "Δ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Θ ∘ Ω ∘ Χ  (+ Σ, + Ψ)"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        □ declares the commitment scope: what is bound, by whom, for how long, under which constraints,
        and what counts as update-worthy signals. Frame opacity is a drift risk (□ hardens into 'reality').
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Ω determines who bears irreversible cost, who has exit options, and who can veto revision.
        Institutional embedding can convert Ω into coercive leverage unless constrained by D and Χ.
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ is central: lock-in accumulates, windows close, sunk costs rise, and reversibility shrinks.
        Θ pressure intensifies ∇ toward premature binding and action-compulsion.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ persists: uncertainty is not a defect but a boundary condition. Drift begins when Λ is denied
        (certainty narratives, inevitability talk) to legitimate irreversible moves.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Α stabilizes routines and narratives around the commitment ('this is how we do it now').
        Repetition can support coordination but can also harden rigidity and suppress Φ updates.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ is the structural channel for revision: new data, changed constraints, and regime shifts may
        reframe what the commitment means. Φ can remain available even when reversal is costly.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ coordinates conflicting constraints (resources, risks, obligations) into a bounded stance.
        Σ becomes drift-prone when it totalizes (pretends to remove Λ) or bypasses Χ.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ binds the committers to consequence ownership and revision discipline; it does not authorize
        imposing obligations on others (Ψ-externalization is a drift marker).
      distance_chi: >
        Χ is the stop-capability that blocks prophecy/authority conversion: probability does not become
        authorization; being right does not become entitlement—especially after partial confirmation.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signatures are shorthand only. PMS prerequisites remain authoritative:
      Χ depends on Φ/Θ/□; Σ depends on Χ/Φ; Ψ depends on Σ/Θ/Χ. Any configuration presenting
      'Σ without Χ', 'Λ replaced by certainty', or 'Ψ externalized as obligation' indicates drift risk
      and is invalid as a PMS application.

        title: "Minimal anticipatory stance (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Δ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Θ ∘ Χ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Treats commitment as a present stance under irreversibility: the commitment may be necessary
          for coordination, but Λ remains explicit and Χ prevents probability → authorization.
      - signature_id: "ANT_viable_full"
        title: "Viable anticipatory configuration (full PMS chain)"
        formula: "Δ ∘ ∇ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α ∘ Ω ∘ Θ ∘ Φ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ ∘ Ψ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Mature commitment formation disciplines closure pressure (∇), keeps Λ open, audits Ω exposure,
          respects Θ lock-in, preserves Φ for updates, maintains Χ, integrates constraints via Σ without
          totalization, and binds inward via Ψ to consequence ownership (not to superiority).
      - signature_id: "ANT_to_planning_constraint"
        title: "Constraint for any downstream planning / preparedness"
        formula: "requires Χ + D + reversibility"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Irreversible commitments are downstream-planning critical points. Any move that externalizes
          cost onto vulnerable parties, shrinks revisability, or converts uncertainty into coercion is
          structurally PMS-invalid.
    drift_candidates:

      - drift_id: "actionism_neutralizes_Θ"
        label: "Θ neutralized by action-compulsion"
        why_plausible_here: "Time pressure is used to force binding moves while suppressing revision windows and Φ."
      - drift_id: "Χ_suspended"

        label: "Ψ externalized ('others must comply')"
        why_plausible_here: "Binding is shifted outward: commitment becomes imposed obligation on others."
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      The overlay makes explicit the boundary between necessary coordination and illegitimate closure:
      irreversible commitments are where Θ + Ω amplify the temptation to erase Λ and to convert probability
      into authority. ANTICIPATION supplies explicit invalidity markers and post-confirmation discipline
      (restore Χ; refuse entitlement conversion).

  drift_classification:
    drift_present: false
    drift_label: ""
    minimal_drift_signature: ""
    observable_markers:
      - "Guarantee/inevitability language replaces uncertainty budgets (Λ denial)."
      - "Urgency rhetoric converts planning into mandate (Θ → compulsion)."
      - "Commitment success is used as entitlement (Χ erosion; Ω inflation)."
      - "Obligations are imposed on others as proof/compliance demands (Ψ externalization)."

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Irreversible commitments often concentrate downside on parties with least exit options.
      Institutional frames can amplify Ω by turning a stance into status (who is allowed, funded, included).
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Lock-in escalates with sunk costs, public commitments, and third-party reliance. Reversal becomes
      expensive even when Φ signals recontextualization.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Uncertainty remains irreducible (unknown variables, regime shifts, counterfactual opacity).
      Attempts to erase Λ typically substitute brittle certainty narratives that increase drift risk.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Make the operative frame explicit (□): scope, horizon, stakes, and what triggers Φ updates."
      - "Keep Λ explicit: treat uncertainty as a boundary condition, not a defect to be erased."
      - "Maintain Χ under urgency and after partial success: block probability → authorization."
      - "Audit Ω: identify who bears irreversible cost and who has revision power; preserve D."
      - "Use Σ to coordinate constraints without totalization; keep remainder visible."
      - "Bind inward via Ψ: commit to consequence ownership and revision discipline, not to compelling others."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Commitment is used to justify coercion, humiliation, exclusion, surveillance, or status-hardening,
      especially when affected parties lack exit options.
    structural_indicator: >
      Λ is denied (certainty substituted), Χ collapses, Ω becomes leverage, Σ hardens into irreversible
      classification, and Ψ is externalized as imposed obligation.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No instruction for how to commit, what to choose, or when to proceed."
      - "No moral ranking of agents, institutions, or affected parties."
      - "No enforcement / governance / compliance protocol."
      - "No prophecy: no claim that any future outcome is necessary."
    claimed:
      - "Irreversibility is structurally Θ-shaped and amplifies closure pressure."
      - "Uncertainty (Λ) persists and must not be erased to legitimate binding moves."
      - "Viable commitment requires Χ + Φ availability, Σ non-totalization, Ω auditing, and D preservation."
      - "Ψ binds the committers to consequence ownership and revision discipline, not others to compliance."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use 'irreversible commitment' analysis to manufacture certainty, compel action, or convert
      probability/success into authority. Do not externalize Ψ as obligations imposed on others.

  structural_closure: >
    Irreversible commitments are structurally defined by Θ lock-in under Ω exposure gradients: once
    externalized, revision windows shrink and costs accumulate. A PMS-valid reading keeps the move
    frame-bound (□), carries uncertainty explicitly (Λ), maintains stop-capability (Χ), remains update-ready
    via Φ, integrates constraints without totalization (Σ), and binds responsibility inward via Ψ rather than
    converting probability or success into authorization or coercion.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Some decisions can’t be easily undone, and that changes everything. Irreversible commitments create
    lock-in over time and often shift costs onto people who have fewer exit options. The mistake is to
    treat uncertainty as something you can erase by “deciding hard,” or to use probability and urgency as
    a reason to force compliance. This case treats good commitment as bounded, update-aware coordination:
    keep the scope clear, keep uncertainty visible, protect those who bear the downside, and don’t turn
    being confident—or being right—into entitlement.
