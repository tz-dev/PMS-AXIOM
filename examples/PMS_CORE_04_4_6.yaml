    context: >
      A temporality claim is demanded: a praxis configuration must be understood as a
      trajectory rather than a point event. The dispute concerns how sequences,
      persistence, delay, accumulation, and commitment become structurally decisive
      within a frame (□). PMS treats time here as Θ: the operator that makes durable
      trajectories, path dependence, and revisability windows possible in praxis.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Temporality is scoped as trajectory-relevant structuring inside declared frames (□)
        (e.g., promises and commitments, institutional processes, learning and development,
        long-horizon responsibilities, delayed consequences). Outputs are bounded:
        "within this frame, this Θ-structure is present" vs "underdetermined (Λ)".
      protected_constraints:
        - "No metaphysical theory of time is claimed"
        - "No phenomenological claims about subjective experience of time are made"
        - "Temporal claims must declare frame (□) and temporal grain (Θ) (horizon, cadence, lag) explicitly"
        - "Reversibility discipline applies: trajectory claims are revisable under Φ (reframing) and Λ (missing events/evidence)"
        - "Dignity-in-practice (D) constrains temporal enforcement under asymmetry (Ω) (no coercive deadlines-as-verdicts)"
      out_of_frame:
        - "Time as a final ontological substance or metaphysical doctrine"
        - "Person-level trait inference from time-handling (e.g., 'lazy', 'disciplined')"
        - "Totalizing narratives that override declared frames and reversibility windows"
    temporality:
      time_scale: "multi-step trajectories, persistence, lag effects, and horizon-dependent commitments (Θ)"
      iteration_rhythm: "repeat cycles: enact → feedback/non-event → adjust → restabilize"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "records, memory, and institutional carry-over that preserve trajectories (□/Θ)"
        - "repeatable routines and scripts that stabilize cadence (Α)"
        - "commitments, policies, and roles that bind continuity across time (Σ→Ψ when formalized)"
      reversibility_window: >
        Trajectory interpretations remain revisable while alternative framings (Φ) remain admissible,
        while relevant events/non-events are still unfolding (Λ), and while binding has not fixed
        obligations or interpretations (Ψ). Where binding exists (e.g., contract, role-duty, precedent),
        revision requires explicit re-integration (Σ) and re-authorization within the frame (□).
    roles:
      - role_label: "Planner / narrator (trajectory constructor)"
        function: "Constructs a temporality model: horizon, cadence, milestones, and revision windows for coordination"
        exposure_profile: "Medium; exposed to contestation of forecasts, delays, and revision demands"
        notes: "Operates via □ horizon selection, Θ ordering, and Σ integration; must preserve Λ residues."
      - role_label: "Enacting role (trajectory bearer)"
        function: "Carries commitments and costs across time; enacts under delay, accumulation, and lock-in"
        exposure_profile: "High; exposed to Θ lock-in and to Ω-driven deadline enforcement"
        notes: "Not evaluated; treated as structurally exposed to trajectory costs and reversibility constraints."
      - role_label: "Gatekeeper / scheduler (authority over time)"
        function: "Sets or enforces cadence, deadlines, and revision windows inside the frame"
        exposure_profile: "High leverage, lower exposure; can externalize time-costs"
        notes: "Represents Ω gradients that can convert temporal structure into coercive closure if Χ is dropped."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      A divergence becomes legible: expected vs actual timing, stable vs unstable sequences,
      present state vs anticipated future, progress vs delay. Δ sharpens "before/after" contrasts
      and invites trajectory modeling.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Closure pressure to turn unfolding time into a decision: set a deadline, declare a failure,
      demand commitment, or force a milestone. ∇ tends to compress trajectories into point verdicts.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "Expected feedback does not arrive (silence, missing update, delayed response)."
      - "Expected progress step does not occur (stall, regression, repeated postponement)."
      - "Expected reversibility window closes without explicit acknowledgment (implicit lock-in)."

    operator_chain: ["Ψ","Σ","Χ","Φ","Θ","Ω","Α","Λ","□","∇","Δ"]
    reduced_signature: "PMS_CORE_TEMPORALITY_Theta_As_Trajectory_With_Lambda_Reversibility"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        Θ is always frame-scoped (□): what counts as "late", "due", "persistent", or "complete"
        depends on declared purpose (coordination, responsibility, development, safety, care).
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Ω shapes time: authorities can set cadence and deadlines; exposed roles bear delay costs.
        Ω gradients can turn timing into enforcement and status claims if Χ is suspended.
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ makes trajectories: sequence, persistence, lag, accumulation, and path dependence.
        Commitments and responsibilities become possible because structures can extend across time.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ appears as missing events, delayed signals, and counterfactual opacity ("would it have worked later?").
        PMS preserves Λ rather than laundering it into false certainty about trajectories.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Α stabilizes cadence: repeated rhythms, routines, and institutional cycles become default timelines
        that can dominate even when Λ suggests the timeline is underdetermined or changing.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ shifts temporal interpretation by embedding the same trajectory into a new frame (e.g., from "learning"
        to "liability", from "care" to "performance"). Φ changes what counts as progress, delay, or completion.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ integrates multiple temporal demands (short-term urgency vs long-term commitment, conflicting schedules,
        multi-role constraints) into a coherent trajectory account compatible with the frame.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ binds trajectories into commitments: deadlines, promises, role-duties, policies, or identity-relevant
        continuity. Ψ is structurally expensive and requires Χ + reversibility discipline.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ prevents point-verdict collapse: keeps temporality readable as trajectory with explicit horizons,
        and blocks coercive deadline-as-essence moves under Ω.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Common hygiene failure: collapsing Θ (trajectory) into Δ/∇ point closure (single timestamp verdict),
      and then hardening into Ψ obligations without Χ, without preserving Λ (missing steps), and without Φ
      tracking (frame shifts). Valid PMS application keeps time-claims frame-bound, revisable, and dignity-constrained.

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Those who set cadence (institutions, managers, gatekeepers) often bear less direct time-cost than those
      who must enact under deadlines and delays. Contest capacity over timelines is uneven under Ω.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Trajectories become sticky once recorded and operationalized (schedules, contracts, precedents, process maps):
      revision requires coordination and re-authorization; early closure creates path dependence and sunk costs.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Residue load consists of missing signals, delayed feedback, uncertain horizons, non-linear progress,
      and counterfactual opacity about alternative pacing. Λ can remain high even when decisions must be made.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Declare the frame (□) and temporal grain (Θ): horizon, cadence, lag assumptions, and decision purpose."
      - "Prefer Θ-trajectory accounts over point verdicts when commitments and consequences are extended."
      - "Make Λ explicit (missing steps, delayed signals, uncertain horizons) instead of laundering closure."
      - "Track Φ when temporal meaning shifts across frames (learning vs liability vs performance)."
      - "Use Σ to integrate conflicting temporal demands and roles rather than compressing into a single clock."
      - "Apply Χ to resist coercive deadline-as-essence moves under Ω; keep reversibility live unless Ψ is legitimate."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Temporal structure is used as coercive closure: deadlines and delays are converted into verdicts,
      humiliation, or irreversible status claims, especially where Ω gradients limit contest capacity.
    structural_indicator: >
      Ψ-hardening without Χ: a timeline becomes a binding moralized verdict; Λ is suppressed; Φ shifts are ignored;
      alternative Σ integrations (revised pacing, multi-factor constraints) are disallowed; costs externalize down Ω.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No metaphysical proof or theory of time is provided."
      - "No phenomenological account of subjective time-experience is provided."
      - "No person-level trait or moral ranking is derived from timing patterns."
      - "No enforcement guidance for institutions is provided."
    claimed:
      - "Temporality (Θ) is modeled as trajectory structure enabling persistence, commitments, and lock-in within frames (□)."
      - "Λ residues (missing events, delayed signals, horizon uncertainty) are preserved as structural outputs."
      - "Α stabilizes cadence; Φ shifts temporal meaning across frames; Σ integrates competing temporal demands; Ψ binds commitments."
      - "Χ + reversibility + D constrain temporal claims and enforcement under Ω."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use this case to weaponize time (deadlines, delays, pacing) for blame, coercion, or irreversible labeling.
      Outputs are structural descriptions of how temporality operates within frames, not verdicts about persons.

  structural_closure: >
    PMS reframes time as a praxis-structural trajectory configuration: Δ makes divergence legible, ∇ pressures closure,
    □ defines admissible temporal grain, Λ marks missing events and horizon underdetermination, Α stabilizes cadence,
    Ω shapes exposure to time-costs and enforcement, Θ constitutes sequences and persistence, Φ shifts temporal meaning
    across frames, Σ integrates competing temporal demands, and Ψ binds trajectories into commitments when legitimate.
    Where closure exceeds what the frame can warrant, Λ remains explicit. Output type: bounded temporality map + explicit
    residue statement, not a metaphysical theory of time.

  plain_language_summary: >
    This case treats “time” as the structure that turns isolated moments into trajectories: sequences, delays,
    accumulation, and commitments. We notice that something is early or late, feel pressure to decide what it means,
    and then choose a context that defines what counts as evidence and what timelines are acceptable. Often some
    uncertainty remains—signals don’t arrive, progress is non-linear, or horizons are unclear—and routines can make
    one timeline feel “obvious” even when it isn’t guaranteed. The goal is to keep time-claims explicit, revisable,
    and non-coercive, especially when power differences determine who bears the costs of delay or enforcement.
