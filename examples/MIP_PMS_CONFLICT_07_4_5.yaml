    assumptions_and_inferences: |
      - Pattern-level structural reading only (no empirical vignette, dataset, institution, or identifiable persons).
      - “Structural injustice” is treated as persistent Ω-gradients reproduced by ordinary operations under stable □ + Α + Θ, sustained by Λ missing corrections.
      - IA box is used as a legitimacy screen for any attempt to turn regime-legibility into coercive closure (culprit-hunting, reputational prosecution, sanction logic).
      - M-responsibility is treated as leverage-dependent: higher for roles controlling frames, criteria, records, and constraint design; lower for roles with priced/near-zero Χ.

        - "No concrete institutional topology: who sets □, who enforces, and what correction channels exist remains unspecified."
        - "No protected-good justification for any imposed closure/enforcement; only generic regime description."

  snapshot:
    short_case_description: |
      A stable allocation regime repeatedly produces unequal exposure, access, and outcomes across role-positions over time.
      The reproduction relies on defaults, gatekeeping, missing corrective events, and path dependence rather than a single culprit.
      The analysis keeps the regime legible as structure while preventing drift into person-level blame, shaming, or enforcement-by-language.

    guiding_question: |
      How can a persistent regime-level Ω-gradient be made legible as □+Α+Θ+Λ (with Χ priced and Φ drift risk)
      while preventing drift into coercive closure (culprit-hunting, reputational prosecution, sanction/selection coupling)?

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: |
      - Persistent Ω-gradients across roles/positions (harm, access, dependence, liability).
      - Stable allocation frames (□): defaults, criteria, eligibility rules, procedural couplings.
      - Α reproduction: ordinary operations stabilize the distribution pattern (“how things work here”).
      - Θ hardening: path dependence makes later correction costly; early distributions compound.
      - Λ missing corrections: absent audits, absent protection, absent safe complaint channels become load-bearing.
      - Χ is required for legibility: distance/pause prevents collapse into verdict or urgency-as-proof.
    variable_elements: |
      - Embedding/publicness: private/institutional/public/media-amplified contexts change exposure and drift risk.
      - Record coupling and documentation durability (optional but decisive for Θ/Ω amplification).
      - Pricing and availability of Χ: whether appeal/pause/exit is safe or punished.
      - Φ use: production-condition inquiry vs substitution/prosecution (“policy-by-shame”).
      - Σ handling: partial reforms vs Σ-as-verdict demanded as moral proof; iterative vs one-shot.
      - Binding topology (Ψ): which colliding commitments remain (efficiency vs access; risk control vs inclusion) and who controls them.
    unfair_high_M_zones: |
      - R1: where Χ≈0 and predictability/alternatives are structurally constrained, high individual M/blame is unfair.
      - R2: where gatekeepers act within rigid □ with low discretion, person-level guilt totalization is structurally misleading; M shifts to constraint/design holders where present.
      - Any actor pressured into instant closure under Θ/Ω where Φ/Χ are blocked: M ceilings apply (model ceiling_rule).
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: |
      - “The system did it” used to evade responsibility for avoidable levers (rule design, audit frequency, complaint protections, record/publicity coupling).
      - “No one could have acted differently” asserted without mapping which roles actually control □, timelines, documentation, and repair channels.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: |
        Actors can often perceive unequal outcomes and frictions, but may not perceive the reproduction mechanics:
        how □ defaults + Α routines + Θ compounding + Λ missing corrections sustain Ω without a single culprit.
        Observers may conflate public narratives with production conditions.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: |
        Stable disparities across cycles; recurring “exceptions” that align with the same groups/positions; complaint channels that do not protect the vulnerable;
        procedural delays that concentrate costs; record artifacts that harden narratives; “urgency-as-proof” demands; drift into person labeling.
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: |
        Confusing regime description with moral exoneration or with moral prosecution; missing R4/R2 leverage in responsibility allocation;
        treating benefits/burdens as personal essence; collapsing “structure” into single-cause stories; ignoring Λ as reproduction material.
    coherence:
      official_narratives: |
        “Rules are neutral.” “It’s merit-based.” “If you comply, you succeed.” “There must be a culprit.” “Name and shame is the only lever.”
      visible_enactments: |
        Repeated application of the same defaults and criteria; proceduralization of complaints; audit deferral; selective enforcement;
        public/institutional narratives that harden into durable records; reforms framed as verdict settlement rather than iterative production-change.
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: |
        Local coherence can be high within a frame (actors follow procedures), while joint coherence fails at regime level (Ω persists across Θ).
        Coherence breaks when neutrality narratives deny patterned outcomes, or when “injustice” language is used to authorize coercion without IA criteria.
    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: |
        - Declare the unit (□): system/process description, not person verdict.
        - Preserve Χ: protect safe pause/appeal/exit; prevent urgency-as-proof and audience coercion.
        - Use Φ for production-conditions: identify which defaults, criteria, and missing corrections reproduce Ω.
        - Allocate responsibility by leverage: highlight who controls □/audits/records (R4/R2) rather than concentrating blame on constrained roles (R1).
        - Prevent downstream coupling into sanction/selection based on regime language alone.
        - Protect D constraints: prohibit shaming/ranking and dehumanizing compression.
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: |
        Responsibility often shifts onto proximate gatekeepers or affected individuals (culprit-hunting), while constraint design and record/publicity control remain under-scrutinized.
        Conversely, responsibility can be refused via “system inevitability” rhetoric that blocks available mitigations and repair levers.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: |
        Under Θ, disparities compound; under publicness/records, narratives harden and become difficult to correct.
        Blame-driven closure can add secondary harms (shaming, scapegoating, exclusion) beyond the regime harms themselves.
    power:
      formal_power_distribution: |
        Template-level: varies by embedding. Institutional contexts often centralize control over criteria, documentation, and timelines;
        affected positions typically face higher compliance burdens and lower protection in complaint pathways.
      factual_power_distribution: |
        R4/R2 hold leverage over □ defaults, audits, records, and timeline coupling; R1 bears harm exposure with priced/limited Χ;
        R3 may have high mobility/Χ and low harm exposure. Publicness multiplies exposure without proportional control for affected parties.
      used_alternatives: |
        - Procedural continuation within existing frames (□ persistence) with local accommodations (Σ local patches)
        - Narrative stabilization (Α) via institutional legitimacy stories (“neutral rules”)
        - Recontextualization (Φ) toward audits/production-conditions (sometimes) or toward prosecution (substitution risk)
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: |
        - Safe and low-cost appeal/pause/exit (Χ) for affected positions
        - Regular audits and correction triggers (Λ reduction) that are resourced and protective
        - Record-limitation/sunset norms to reduce Θ-hardening via durable artifacts
        - Participation of affected positions in defining repair thresholds and acceptable tradeoffs
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: |
        D module remains OFF. Dignity risk is handled structurally: the main risk is secondary harm via shaming/ranking and dehumanizing compression
        when regime description is converted into person-level prosecution or “policy-by-shame.”

  ia_protection:
    transparency_measures: |
      - Declare the unit (□): analysis targets policies/defaults/processes, not persons or group essences.
      - Make production conditions explicit in any concrete application: who controls □, which audits/corrections exist, and where Λ persists.
      - Name Ω gradients: distinguish harm exposure, control over frames/timelines/records, and attribution exposure.
      - Separate observation vs evaluation: document which claims are structural inference vs case material.
    time_bound_measures: |
      - Time-bound correction cycles: defined audit intervals, review checkpoints, and escalation limits.
      - Prevent indefinite “narrative reuse”: sunset norms for records and public claims that would otherwise harden Θ.
      - Treat reforms (Σ) as iterative pilots where appropriate, with scheduled reassessment.
    reversibility_measures: |
      - Protect contestability: safe complaint/appeal/exit (Χ) without retaliation; correction clauses for reinterpretation.
      - Prohibit irreversible downstream coupling: no hiring/firing/sanction/selection logic derived from regime-language alone.
      - Record-limitation: minimize durable person-linkable artifacts; keep regime claims at system level.

        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 5–8/10 (highest for actors enabling enforcement-by-language and durable record coupling)"
    course_in_words: |
      The scene tends to move from early regime legibility toward closure-demand escalation as Θ and Ω amplify costs, exposure, and frustration.
      Where Χ is protected and Φ remains inquiry-oriented, the trajectory can stabilize as “regime legibility without culprit-hunting.”
      Where publicness/records harden outputs, structural language drifts into prosecution and generates secondary harms.
    responsibility_viability_range: |
      Viability is highest when □ is explicit, Χ is protected, Φ is production-inquiry, and correction cycles are time-bounded and reversible.
      Viability collapses when Σ is demanded as moral proof, when publicness/records harden narratives, and when outputs are operationalized for sanction/selection.

      Counter-reading: some patterns described as “structural” are driven by a smaller set of decision points with identifiable leverage holders;
      conversely, some “neutral” criteria are active instruments of exclusion. A safe application must map concrete □ control, audit deferrals,
      and complaint suppression before accepting “no culprit” as the right regime framing.

  analyst_reflection:
    self_implication_notes: |
      Regime language can be used both to protect dignity (against scapegoating) and to launder authority (to punish or to excuse).
      This reading therefore keeps the unit explicit (system/process), insists on reversibility and Χ protections, and requires an avoidable-lever check
      before accepting “structural persistence” as the whole story.
    possible_next_steps: |
      - Add one concrete vignette/data slice and map: □ control, Α reproduction loop, Θ compounding points, Λ missing corrections, Χ pricing, Φ treatment, Ω gradients.
      - Specify actual publicness/records and add matching safeguards (sunsets, correction clauses, anti-prosecution coupling).
      - Add explicit if/then criteria for when regime critique becomes IA-relevant coercion (punished Χ, prosecuted Φ, Σ-as-verdict, selection coupling).
      - Add a short checklist distinguishing hard constraints from avoidable design choices (audit frequency, complaint protections, documentation rules).

    title: "Praxeological analysis of a practice pattern: Structural injustice as regime-level reproduction of asymmetry"
    one_paragraph_overview: |
      This reading treats “structural injustice” as a regime pattern: stable rules and defaults repeatedly produce unequal burdens and unequal access over time,
      even when many local actions look reasonable inside their immediate procedures. The key risk is not only the unequal distribution itself, but how people
      respond to it—by forcing a culprit verdict, weaponizing public exposure, or turning structural language into shaming and enforcement. The analysis therefore
      keeps attention on production conditions (rules, audits, complaint protections, and record coupling) while protecting pause/appeal and reversibility. It stays
      system-bound and does not authorize sanctions, selection, or governance enforcement based on the label “structural injustice.”
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Structural injustice is modeled as persistent Ω-gradients reproduced by □ + Α + Θ with Λ missing corrections; it can persist without a single culprit."
      - "Θ-hardening and priced Χ turn time and procedure into inequality; safe appeal/pause is a central leverage point."
      - "Φ can enable production-condition inquiry, but under publicness/records tends to drift into prosecution (exposure capture) unless constrained."
      - "Responsibility should follow leverage: higher for roles controlling □/audits/records, lower for roles facing near-zero alternatives under Ω/Θ."
      - "Misuse risk: regime language becomes shaming, reputational enforcement, or selection/sanction coupling—creating secondary harms beyond the regime harms."
    maturity_summary: |
      In terms of maturity in practice, the pattern supports adult enactment when it keeps the unit structural, protects pause/appeal, and sustains production-condition inquiry without collapsing into verdict or shame.
    ia_box_summary: |
      Structurally, IA risk rises when closure demands become non-transparent, unjustified, indefinite, or non-contestable—especially when pauses are punished and narratives are hardened into durable records.
    dignity_summary: ""
    trajectory_summary: |
      Over time, the constellation tends to drift from early regime legibility toward blame/prosecution as time hardens and exposure increases, unless pause/appeal and inquiry remain protected.
    open_questions_summary: |
      Important open questions are the concrete embedding (publicness/records), who controls frames and audits, how appeal/pause is priced, and which mitigations are actually available.
    conclusion: |
      The model suggests using “structural injustice” as a regime description to prevent scapegoating and to keep attention on production conditions and correction channels.
      For safer practice, declare the unit, protect appeal/pause, time-bound correction cycles, and prevent downstream coupling into sanctions or selection—especially under publicness and durable records.
