        why_this_addon: >
          PMS-core can represent asymmetry (Ω), temporality (Θ), lock-in (Α),
          and reflective correction (Φ/Χ/Σ/Ψ), but it does not by itself formalize
          the ANTICIPATION-specific drift corridor where downstream-impact talk
          becomes prophecy or authority: Λ-collapse (uncertainty erased), probability
          → action-compulsion, and “we foresee consequences” → entitlement to compel
          others under Ω. The ANTICIPATION overlay keeps downstream assessment as a
          present stance that carries Λ under Θ, with explicit invalidity markers
          for probability → authorization and Ψ-externalization.

    context: >
      A decision is taken inside a bounded frame (□) but produces effects that
      propagate over time (Θ), across roles and institutions (Ω), and through
      stabilized routines (Α). The structural problem is not “predict everything,”
      but to keep downstream consequence-claims scene-bound, uncertainty-aware (Λ),
      revisable (Φ), and non-authorizing (Χ + D + reversibility), while binding
      responsibility inward (Ψ) rather than externalizing obligation.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Decision-making inside an explicit role-space: what is being decided,
        which levers exist, who is affected, and what is out of scope.
      protected_constraints:
        - "Downstream effects are assessed as bounded hypotheses, not necessity claims."
        - "Uncertainty remains structurally active (Λ is carried, not erased)."
        - "Reversibility remains explicit: revision channels (Φ) are named where feasible."
        - "Distance (Χ) blocks probability → authorization and urgency → coercion."
        - "Asymmetry (Ω) must be audited: exposure/capacity/exit options differ."
        - "Integration (Σ) coordinates multiple impact channels without totalization."
        - "Self-binding (Ψ) binds the decision-holder(s) to consequence ownership, not to being right."
        - "Dignity-in-practice (D) constrains downstream handling under Ω (no shaming/ranking/coercion)."

        - "third-party reliance and contractual embedding (Ω + Θ amplification)"
      reversibility_window: >
        Highest before externalization (public commitment, infrastructure build-out,
        policy embedding). Shrinks as reliance, sunk costs, and institutional
        coupling increase. Φ remains possible, but reversal becomes structurally costly.

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Primary distinction becomes legible: local decision vs distributed consequences;
      direct effects vs downstream/second-order effects; reversible adjustments vs
      irreversible lock-in; bounded hypothesis vs totalizing narrative.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Closure pressure to pre-justify the decision: desire for certainty, control,
      legitimacy, and speed; temptation to treat anticipated downstream effects as
      authorization to compel compliance.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "No single evidence event guarantees the full downstream chain."
      - "Feedback is delayed/partial; many consequences remain unobserved."
      - "Counterfactuals are opaque (what would have happened otherwise)."
      - "Regime shifts can invalidate prior relevance assumptions (□ drift)."

    reduced_signature: "Δ ∘ □ ∘ Ω ∘ Θ ∘ Λ ∘ Χ  (+ Φ; + Σ; + Ψ)"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        Downstream impact talk is valid only inside explicit frames: declared scope,
        horizon, levers, and what counts as evidence. Frame opacity is a primary
        drift risk (□ hardening into “reality itself”).
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Downstream effects usually distribute exposure unevenly (who bears cost,
        who has voice, who can exit). Ω must be audited before any strong claims
        are operationalized; D constrains how Ω is handled.
      theta_temporality: >
        Effects propagate over time; lock-in grows; windows close. Θ pressure
        intensifies ∇ and invites premature certainty/authority conversion.
      lambda_residue: >
        Uncertainty is irreducible in complex downstream chains. Structural validity
        requires carrying Λ explicitly; drift begins when Λ is replaced by certainty
        narratives for legitimacy.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Decisions stabilize routines and narratives (Α). This can support coordination
        or harden into rigidity that suppresses Φ updates and rewrites Λ away.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ is the revision channel: new data, new constraints, or new stakeholder
        visibility reframe what the decision means and what counts as evidence.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ coordinates multiple downstream channels (economic, social, technical,
        institutional) without totalization; keeps remainder visible and prevents
        single-metric dominance.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ binds decision-holders to consequence ownership and update discipline
        (including acknowledging uncertainty), not to correctness and not to
        compelling others. Externalizing Ψ is a drift marker.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ is stop-capability: blocks probability → authorization, urgency → compulsion,
        and “downstream foresight” → entitlement, especially under institutional Ω.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signatures are shorthand only. PMS prerequisites remain authoritative:
      Χ depends on Φ/Θ/□; Σ depends on Χ/Φ; Ψ depends on Σ/Θ/Χ. Any configuration
      where Λ is replaced by certainty, Σ is asserted without Χ, or Ψ is shifted
      outward as imposed obligation is invalid as a PMS application.

        how_it_applies_here: >
          Downstream-effect reasoning is treated as a present stance: bounded impact
          hypotheses carried under Θ with explicit Λ and maintained Χ. It is not
          action-authorizing by itself.

        how_it_applies_here: >
          Mature downstream assessment disciplines closure impulses (∇), keeps Λ
          explicit, audits Ω exposure, respects Θ lock-in, stays update-ready via Φ,
          maintains Χ, integrates multiple channels (Σ) without totalization, and
          binds responsibility inward (Ψ).
      - signature_id: "ANT_to_planning_constraint"
        title: "Constraint for any downstream planning / preparedness"
        formula: "requires Χ + D + reversibility"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          When downstream effects are used to justify commitments that affect others
          (allocation, gating, restriction, infrastructure), explicit validity gates
          must hold. Impact talk never supplies authority.
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "certainty_replaces_Λ"
        label: "Λ replaced by certainty"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Complex downstream chains invite narrative closure: uncertainty budgets
          disappear and hypothetical links are treated as necessity.
      - drift_id: "actionism_neutralizes_Θ"
        label: "Θ neutralized by action-compulsion"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Time pressure (“windows are closing”) turns downstream talk into “must act,”
          collapsing revisability and suppressing Φ.
      - drift_id: "Ω_instrumentalized"
        label: "Ω instrumentalized"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Institutions may convert downstream-risk narratives into control levers,
          shifting burdens onto low-exit parties.
      - drift_id: "Χ_suspended"
        label: "Χ suspended ('I know better')"
        why_plausible_here: >
          High-stakes rhetoric or partial validation erodes stop-capability and
          converts prediction into authority.
      - drift_id: "Ψ_externalized"
        label: "Ψ externalized ('others must comply')"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Downstream arguments are used to impose obligations on others, rather than
          binding decision-holders to consequence ownership.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      ANTICIPATION makes explicit that downstream-effect reasoning must remain a
      Λ-carrying present stance under Θ, and adds formal invalidity markers for
      probability → authorization (especially under Ω) and Ψ-externalization. It
      foregrounds post-justification discipline: even when impacts are likely,
      Χ must remain active and reversibility rights must be preserved.

    observable_markers:
      - "Phrase-patterns like 'we must act because the downstream consequences are clear'"
      - "Uncertainty budgets removed; distributions rewritten as guarantees"
      - "Suppression of revision channels ('no time to revisit')"
      - "Obligation shifted outward ('they must comply')"

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Downstream effects often concentrate burdens on parties with least capacity
      and least exit options. Exposure differs by role; institutional embedding can
      amplify Ω by converting hypotheses into status or constraint.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Lock-in grows via sunk costs, infrastructure coupling, public commitments,
      and third-party reliance. Later revision becomes expensive even when Φ indicates
      recontextualization.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Uncertainty remains irreducible in complex systems: hidden variables, delayed
      feedback, counterfactual opacity, and regime shifts. Attempts to erase Λ
      typically increase brittleness and coercion drift.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Declare the frame (□): scope, horizon, levers, evidence class, and what is out of frame."
      - "Carry Λ explicitly: keep uncertainty budgets visible; treat chains as hypotheses, not necessities."
      - "Audit Ω: map who bears irreversible cost, who has voice, and who can exit."
      - "Respect Θ: name lock-in points and shrinking reversibility windows."
      - "Keep Φ available: specify update triggers; treat recontextualization as built-in, not as failure."
      - "Maintain Χ under pressure: block probability → authorization and urgency → compulsion."
      - "Integrate via Σ without totalization: coordinate multiple impact channels with explicit remainder."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Downstream-effect narratives are used to justify coercion, humiliation,
      exclusion, or surveillance—especially when affected parties have low exit options.
    structural_indicator: >
      Λ is denied (certainty substituted), Χ collapses, Ω becomes leverage, Σ hardens
      into irreversible classification, and Ψ is externalized as imposed obligation.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "A future-truth guarantee about downstream chains."
      - "An action mandate or enforcement recipe."
      - "A method for ranking persons/groups or attributing intent."
      - "Elimination of uncertainty or closure of Λ."
    claimed:
      - "Downstream effects are structurally Θ-extended and Ω-distributed, with persistent Λ."
      - "Valid downstream reasoning stays frame-bound (□), uncertainty-aware (Λ), revisable (Φ), and non-authorizing (Χ)."
      - "Responsibility is bound inward via Ψ to consequence ownership and update discipline, not externalized as obligation."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use downstream-effect reasoning to manufacture certainty, compel action,
      or convert predictive confidence into authority. Do not externalize Ψ as obligations
      imposed on others. Preserve revisability and protect affected parties under Ω with D.

  structural_closure: >
    Downstream effects of decisions are specified as consequence propagation across time (Θ)
    under uneven exposure and capacity (Ω), stabilized by routines and narratives (Α),
    while uncertainty remains structurally active (Λ). PMS–ANTICIPATION closes the case by
    enforcing boundary discipline: keep the analysis frame-bound (□), carry Λ explicitly,
    maintain Χ against probability → authorization, remain update-ready via Φ, integrate
    without totalization (Σ), preserve D under Ω, and bind responsibility inward via Ψ.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Decisions rarely stop where they are made. Their effects spread over time and often land
    hardest on people who have the least ability to avoid them. Because these chains are complex,
    you can’t turn “likely consequences” into certainty—or use them as a shortcut to force compliance.
    The disciplined move is to keep the scope clear, keep uncertainty visible, stay willing to revise
    when conditions change, and take responsibility for the consequences without treating foresight as authority.
