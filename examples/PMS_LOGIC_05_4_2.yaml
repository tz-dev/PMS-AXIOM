        why_this_addon: >
          PMS-core can model framed inquiry (□), missing determination events (Λ),
          and stabilization of research practice (Α), but it does not by itself
          formalize the logic-level fact that a finite evidence set can remain
          compatible with multiple incompatible theories/models. The LOGIC overlay
          makes visible underdetermination as boundary-managed non-closure
          (□ ∘ Λ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ), rather than a defect to be “eliminated,” and it names
          characteristic drift pressures toward forced closure (Σ-totalization),
          frame lock-in (□-overconstraint), or authority substitution (Ω-inflation).

  scene_packet:
    scene_id: "SCENE_UNDERDETERMINATION_INQUIRY"
    context: >
      Model selection and explanation in empirical inquiry (science, statistics,
      policy analytics, ML/AI evaluation): a finite evidence base is treated as
      sufficient to uniquely determine “the right” theory, causal story, or model.
      The underdetermination claim is that multiple rival models can fit the same
      data while diverging in untested regions, causal commitments, or extrapolation.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Epistemic evaluation within an explicit evidential and modeling regime:
        what counts as admissible data, what success criteria are used (fit,
        simplicity, predictive accuracy, interpretability), and which closure
        is being demanded (“unique best model”).
      protected_constraints:
        - "Evidence is finite and frame-dependent (□); admissibility rules are part of the frame."
        - "Non-closure (Λ) regarding unique determination is admissible and structurally meaningful."
        - "Model fit/coherence (Σ) is coordination within scope, not a warrant of uniqueness."
        - "Distance (Χ) blocks laundering of predictive success into necessity or final authority."
        - "Reversibility: model rankings remain scene-bound and revisable under Φ (new data, new tasks, new frames)."
      out_of_frame:
        - "A proof that one true theory is uniquely recoverable from any finite dataset."
        - "Psychological explanations of why agents prefer one model."
        - "Moral evaluation of rival modelers or schools."
        - "Prescriptive governance about which institutions should enforce which model."

        - "Standards bodies / guidelines / policy documents binding practice (Ψ)"
      reversibility_window: >
        High while multiple models are allowed to coexist and Φ-updates are feasible;
        low once models become infrastructure (standards, regulations, deployed systems)
        and revision costs escalate under Θ.

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Difference between (i) empirical adequacy within a declared evidence frame
      and (ii) unique theoretical determination (a single “correct” model/story).
    nabla_impulse: >
      Pressure to close: the drive to select one model as uniquely warranted,
      for decision, publication, standardization, or deployment.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "No evidence event uniquely selects one theory among multiple empirically adequate rivals."
      - "No frame-internal criterion yields a non-arbitrary, final tie-breaker without remainder."

    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        □ defines what counts as data, what counts as “fit,” and what success means.
        Changing □ can switch which models appear best without changing the world.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Ω appears in who gets to set benchmarks, declare standards, or certify “best”
        models; authority can substitute for boundary discipline.
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ makes underdetermination practically costly: decisions must be made before
        ultimate resolution; lock-in increases over time.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ is the persistent remainder: evidence does not deliver unique determination;
        rival continuations remain compatible with what is observed.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Α stabilizes default model classes, methodological routines, and “best practice”
        narratives even when Λ persists.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ occurs when new tasks, new measurements, or new interpretive aims reframe the
        model comparison (e.g., shift from prediction to causal explanation).
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ yields coherent models and pipelines (workable coordination) but does not
        authorize uniqueness; multiple Σ can coexist under the same □.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ appears when institutions bind to standards, toolchains, or regulatory models,
        making revision costly and politically loaded.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ holds restraint against turning coherence, success, or consensus into “must”:
        it keeps underdetermination explicit rather than treated as failure.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Attempts to eliminate underdetermination by declaring a single “final” model
      typically deny Λ and shortcut Χ and Φ, converting Σ (coordination) into authority.
      Reduced signatures do not negate PMS prerequisites.

          Coordinates model choice and use while explicitly carrying the non-uniqueness
          remainder (Λ) inside declared evidence frames (□), with Χ preventing authority
          laundering from fit or consensus.

        title: "Pre-moral level of justification"
        formula: "Δ ∘ ∇ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Marks the pre-evaluative structure of inquiry: impulse toward explanation
          (∇) is framed (□), meets non-closure (Λ), and stabilizes into practice (Α)
          without implying any normative “ought.”

      - drift_id: "dogmatism_sigma_totalization"
        label: "Dogmatism (Σ-totalization)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Closure pressure (∇) invites treating one integrated model (Σ) as final truth,
          denying Λ and immunizing against revision.
      - drift_id: "technocratic_reduction_frame_overconstraint"
        label: "Technocratic reduction (□-overconstraint)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Benchmark frames and metrics are treated as exhaustive reality; what is
          unmeasured is dismissed or forced into the frame, producing blind spots.
      - drift_id: "authority_capture_omega_inflation"
        label: "Authority capture (Ω-inflation)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Institutional power substitutes for evidential warrant (“best because certified”),
          shifting exposure to downstream users while Λ is not carried by authorities.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      The overlay makes explicit that underdetermination is a logic-level boundary
      condition: finite evidence does not yield unique continuation to a single theory.
      It distinguishes (i) operational model coordination (Σ) from (ii) claims of
      necessity/uniqueness, and it names how closure pressure commonly produces
      substitution drifts via Σ-totalization, □-lock-in, or Ω-authority.

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Evaluators and institutions can declare “the best model” while externalizing the
      uncertainty/risk of Λ to practitioners and downstream users who must act under Θ.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      As models become embedded in infrastructure (tooling, standards, regulation,
      deployed systems), switching costs rise and Φ-updates become politically and
      operationally expensive.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      The non-uniqueness remainder persists: disagreement reappears at boundary cases,
      extrapolation, causal interpretation, and distribution shift.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Make the evidence and evaluation frame (□) explicit, including its claim-strength."
      - "Carry Λ explicitly (non-uniqueness) rather than forcing uniqueness by ad hoc tie-breakers."
      - "Use Φ to recontextualize comparison when aims change (prediction vs explanation; new domains)."
      - "Apply Χ to prevent fit/consensus from becoming metaphysical authority."
      - "Stabilize practice with Α (benchmarks, exemplars) while keeping reversibility open (no finality claims)."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: "Underdetermination is used to humiliate, exclude, or silence disagreement under steep Ω."
    structural_indicator: >
      Λ is denied or weaponized: either forced closure is imposed (“only one rational model”)
      or the remainder is used to disqualify others (“nothing can be known”), with Χ suppressed.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "That inquiry is arbitrary or that evidence is irrelevant."
      - "That one true theory cannot exist."
      - "That any specific model choice is (in general) invalid or illegitimate."
      - "Any prescription for institutional enforcement or policy."
    claimed:
      - "Finite evidence within a frame can be compatible with multiple incompatible models (Λ persists)."
      - "Stability of practice is explained by attractors (Α) and institutional bindings (Ψ), not by unique determination."
      - "LOGIC discipline is boundary management: carry Λ within explicit □ while coordinating Σ under Χ."
    misuse_warning: >
      This case must not be used to (i) enforce interpretive hierarchy by declaring one
      model uniquely necessary, (ii) weaponize Λ into nihilism (“nothing matters”), or
      (iii) disqualify persons or groups via alleged irrationality.

  structural_closure: >
    Underdetermination is re-specified as a boundary condition of theory–evidence linkage:
    within a declared evidence frame (□), the expected unique selection event does not
    occur (Λ). Inquiry stabilizes through repeated routines and benchmarks (Α) and may
    become institutionally bound (Ψ) under asymmetry (Ω) and time (Θ). PMS–LOGIC closes
    the analysis by treating model choice as frame-bound coordination (Σ) under reflective
    restraint (Χ), with Φ reserved for scope and aim revisions rather than forced closure.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Sometimes the same set of observations can support more than one incompatible
    explanation. That doesn’t mean evidence is useless—it means the data, as framed, do
    not uniquely decide the issue. PMS–LOGIC treats this as a normal structural limit:
    practices become stable through shared routines and standards, while some uncertainty
    remains. Keeping that remainder explicit helps prevent “best current fit” from being
    mistaken for absolute certainty or for institutional authority.
