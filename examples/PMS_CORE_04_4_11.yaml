        why_this_addon: >
          No add-on is applied. PMS core is sufficient because “truth” is treated here
          functionally as a structural closure device inside frames (□): a stabilization
          of differences (Δ) and expectations (Λ) into integrated (Σ) and possibly bound
          (Ψ) commitments under temporality (Θ) and asymmetry (Ω), rather than as a
          metaphysical correspondence doctrine or a moralized status weapon.

    context: >
      A truth claim is demanded in a coordination setting: a scene requires deciding
      what counts as correct, admissible, settled, or actionable. The structural question
      is how “truth” functions as a closure mechanism that reduces ambiguity, aligns roles,
      stabilizes expectations, and enables binding commitments—while remaining frame-bound,
      revisable, and dignity-constrained under asymmetry.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Truth is scoped as functional validity inside declared frames (□): scientific inference,
        engineering verification, legal fact-finding, institutional reporting, interpersonal
        coordination, or model documentation. “True” means “settled enough for this frame’s
        decision purpose,” with explicit evidence rules and revision pathways.
      protected_constraints:
        - "No metaphysical theory of truth (correspondence/coherence/pragmatism) is claimed as final."
        - "Truth claims must declare the operative frame (□): decision purpose, admissible evidence, and error tolerances."
        - "Truth is treated as revisable: new evidence, recontextualization (Φ), and Λ residues can reopen closure."
        - "Asymmetry (Ω) must be tracked: who can declare truth, who bears costs of error, who can contest."
        - "Temporality (Θ) must be explicit: deadlines, audit horizons, persistence of records, and revision windows."
        - "Dignity-in-practice (D) constrains truth-use under Ω: no humiliation, shaming, or coercive verdicting."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Truth as ontological essence of persons or groups."
        - "Truth as a weapon for irreversible labeling, moral ranking, or enforcement guidance."
        - "Totalizing truth claims that override declared frames, tolerances, and revision pathways."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "Immediate decisions to long-horizon stabilization (Θ): updates, audits, and path dependence."
      iteration_rhythm: "Claim → test/contest → provisional closure → revision cycles; cadence depends on □."
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "Records, logs, publications, and institutional memory stabilizing claims (□/Θ)."
        - "Repeated validation routines and review cycles forming attractors (Α)."
        - "Precedents, standards, and policies binding closure into obligations (Σ→Ψ)."
      reversibility_window: >
        Truth closure remains revisable while contest channels and evidence updates remain open (□),
        while missing signals remain explicit (Λ), and while binding has not hardened the claim into
        doctrine/precedent/identity commitments (Ψ). Once bound, revision requires explicit Σ
        re-integration and re-authorization inside the frame.
    roles:
      - role_label: "R1_claim_maker_proposer"
        function: "Proposes a truth candidate (statement/model/report) for the frame’s purpose."
        exposure_profile: "Medium exposure to refutation, correction cost, and reputational lock-in."
        notes: "Often incentivized by ∇ closure pressure (speed, certainty, status)."
      - role_label: "R2_validator_tester_checker"
        function: "Tests admissibility and reliability; enforces evidence rules and tolerances."
        exposure_profile: "Medium-to-high exposure to missed errors; can be overruled under Ω."
        notes: "Operates via □ criteria; must preserve Λ and revision pathways."
      - role_label: "R3_decider_gatekeeper_authority"
        function: "Declares closure (what counts as true enough) and operationalizes it."
        exposure_profile: "High leverage under Ω; may externalize error costs to others."
        notes: "Can harden closure into Ψ commitments; requires Χ and D discipline."
      - role_label: "R4_affected_party_cost_bearer"
        function: "Bears downstream costs of truth/error (resource allocation, sanctions, safety risks)."
        exposure_profile: "High exposure; often limited contest capacity under Ω."
        notes: "Truth as closure can become coercive if D and reversibility are suspended."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      A distinction becomes salient (Δ): competing descriptions, measurements, narratives,
      or models diverge; “this vs that” must be selected for coordination or record.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Closure pressure (∇) to decide: act now, stop debate, allocate resources, assign
      responsibility, or stabilize a narrative. ∇ tends to compress uncertainty into certainty.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "Expected decisive evidence does not arrive (missing data, unobservable variables, measurement limits)."
      - "Expected contest/repair step does not occur (no review, no correction channel, silence)."
      - "Expected frame declaration is absent (truth asserted without □: purpose, tolerance, admissibility)."

  operator_mapping:
    operator_chain: ["Δ", "∇", "□", "Λ", "Α", "Ω", "Θ", "Φ", "Χ", "Σ", "Ψ"]
    reduced_signature: "Δ ∘ ∇ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α ∘ Ω ∘ Θ ∘ Φ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ ∘ Ψ"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        □ defines what “true” can mean here: admissible evidence, tolerances,
        decision purpose, and revision procedures. Without □, “truth” becomes
        an unscoped status claim.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Ω shapes who can declare truth and who bears error costs. Under Ω, truth
        can become enforcement-like if Χ and D are suspended.
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ structures truth as trajectory: stabilization across time, persistence
        of records, audit horizons, and revision windows; lock-in increases with
        operationalization.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ persists as missing evidence, delayed signals, underdetermination, and
        counterfactual opacity. PMS keeps Λ explicit rather than laundering closure.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Α stabilizes “truth routines”: repeated validation practices, institutional
        scripts, and default narratives that become the path-of-least-resistance.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ shifts truth meaning across frames (lab result → policy fact → social narrative);
        what counts as admissible and sufficient changes with frame transport.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ integrates heterogeneous evidence, viewpoints, and constraints into a coherent
        claim suitable for the frame’s decision purpose.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ binds truth closure into commitments: standards, precedents, contracts, identity
        narratives, or institutional doctrine—without implying metaphysical finality.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ prevents truth-as-verdict fusion: maintains reflective distance, keeps claims
        scene-bound and revisable, and blocks coercive “truth = person-value” moves.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      A common failure is Δ/∇ → Ψ collapse: difference plus closure pressure hardens
      into doctrine (“this is the truth”) without □ (purpose/tolerance), without preserving
      Λ (missing evidence), without tracking Φ (frame shifts), and without Σ under Χ.
      Valid PMS application treats truth functionally as frame-bound closure with explicit
      revisability and dignity constraints.

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Gatekeepers can declare truth with high leverage while downstream roles bear
      costs of error (resource waste, safety risk, sanctions, reputational damage).
      Contest capacity over “truth” is uneven under Ω.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Truth becomes sticky through Θ: records, precedents, and operational dependencies
      create lock-in. The longer a claim is used, the higher the reversal cost.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Often high: missing data, measurement limits, hidden variables, and delayed
      outcomes persist even when action requires closure.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Declare the frame (□): decision purpose, admissible evidence, tolerance, and revision pathway."
      - "Make Ω explicit: who can declare/override, who bears error costs, who can contest."
      - "Make Θ explicit: horizon, persistence of records, audit cycle, and reversibility window."
      - "Preserve Λ explicitly (missing evidence/under-determination) instead of forcing certainty."
      - "Track Φ when claims move across frames; re-state what “true” means after transport."
      - "Use Σ to integrate heterogeneous evidence and constraints before hardening."
      - "Apply Χ to prevent truth-as-verdict coercion; keep reversibility live unless binding is warranted."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Truth becomes a coercive verdict under asymmetry: “truth” is used to
      humiliate, silence contest, or impose irreversible labels and enforcement.
    structural_indicator: >
      Ψ-hardening without Χ; Λ suppressed; Φ ignored; contest channels blocked;
      error costs externalized down Ω; reversibility treated as illegitimate.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No metaphysical final theory of truth is asserted."
      - "No person-level worth ranking or trait inference is derived from truth claims."
      - "No claim that closure is always justified; no enforcement or punitive guidance."
    claimed:
      - "Truth is modeled functionally as frame-bound closure (□) stabilizing distinctions (Δ) for action/coordination."
      - "Λ residues (missing evidence, underdetermination) are irreducible and must remain explicit."
      - "Ω and Θ shape who can declare truth and how claims lock in over time; Φ shifts meaning across frames."
      - "Σ integrates evidence into coherence; Ψ binds closure into commitments; Χ + reversibility + D constrain use."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use this case to weaponize “truth” for coercion, silencing, shaming,
      or irreversible labeling. Outputs describe how truth-closure operates inside
      frames, not who “deserves” status or punishment.

  structural_closure: >
    PMS reframes “truth” as a functional closure configuration: Δ makes competing
    descriptions legible; ∇ pressures decision; □ defines admissible evidence and
    tolerances; Λ marks missing signals and underdetermination; Α stabilizes routines;
    Ω shapes declaration power and exposure; Θ governs persistence and lock-in; Φ shifts
    meaning across frames; Σ integrates evidence into a coherent claim; Ψ binds closure
    into standards, precedents, or commitments. Where closure exceeds frame warrant,
    Λ remains explicit and reversibility is preserved under Χ and D.

  plain_language_summary: >
    This case treats “truth” as something we use to settle what counts as correct
    enough for a specific purpose—making decisions, coordinating action, or keeping
    records. We notice differences between stories or measurements and feel pressure
    to decide quickly. But evidence can be missing, meanings change when claims move
    between contexts, and power differences affect who gets to declare “the truth”
    and who pays if it is wrong. The goal is to keep truth claims explicit about
    their context and limits, open to revision when new information arrives, and
    non-coercive—so “truth” does not become a weapon for silencing or humiliation.
