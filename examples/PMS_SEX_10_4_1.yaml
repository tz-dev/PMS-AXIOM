        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can map operators and asymmetry, but it does not by itself provide
          sexuality/consent-specific reduced signatures, drift corridors, and viability
          conditions that discipline what “consent” can mean under Ω/Θ/Λ pressure.
          The SEX overlay adds formal markers for invalidity risk (e.g., Ψ leak, Ω as
          steering, Χ loss) and a minimal viability corridor for governable configurations.

        repo: "https://github.com/tz-dev/Maturity-in-Practice"
        schema_version: "MIPractice_case_v2.0_full_with_model_reference"
        why_this_addon: >
          Consent analyses are high-risk for misuse (shaming, coercion, public exposure,
          irreversible labels). MIP is mandatory to evaluate the analysis artifact’s
          governance safety (D0 protection), publicity/misuse corridors, and responsibility ceilings.

  scene_packet:
    scene_id: "PMS_SEX_10_4_1_scene_001"
    context: >
      A sexual interaction occurs in a configuration with a salient power/exposure gradient (Ω),
      where consent language is present but the practical availability of stopping (Χ) and the
      legibility of boundaries (□) are uncertain or contested. The analysis targets validity of
      consent-talk under asymmetry, not personal character or motives.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Consent is treated as a configuration-validity claim: it is meaningful only if the frame
        is explicit (□), asymmetry is nameable/regulable (Ω), temporality is carried as real (Θ),
        non-events are tolerable (Λ), and stop-capability is practically available (Χ).
      protected_constraints:
        - "Structural mapping only; no diagnosis, no motive stories, no person-typing."
        - "No prescriptive sexual guidance; no enforcement heuristics."
        - "All claims are scene-bound and reversible."
        - "Dignity-in-practice (D) must be preserved; no shaming/ranking."
        - "MIP is mandatory due to D0 relevance and misuse potential."

        - "Inferring inner mental states, trauma narratives, or stable traits."
        - "Issuing advice, persuasion scripts, or behavioral instructions."
        - "Public naming, exposure, or irreversible identity attribution."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "minutes to weeks"
      iteration_rhythm: "may be one-off or recurrent; repetition increases Α/Θ path dependence"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "memory and narrative consolidation"
        - "repetition-driven script stabilization (Α)"
        - "accumulating after-effects and reputational stakes (Θ), amplified under publicness overlays"
      reversibility_window: >
        Highest early in the scene when Χ can still be activated before escalation and accumulation
        harden the configuration; decreases as Θ costs accumulate and Α scripts stabilize.
    roles:
      - role_label: "R1"
        function: "higher leverage / lower exposure position inside the scene"
        exposure_profile: "lower immediate cost; higher control of pace/access; may define frame defaults"
        notes: "Role label is structural; no person judgement is implied."
      - role_label: "R2"
        function: "higher exposure / higher downside position inside the scene"
        exposure_profile: "higher immediate and downstream cost; stopping may be priced or punished"
        notes: "Exposure includes bodily, reputational, relational, and temporal accumulation channels."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Differences become salient around boundaries, access, pace, and stakes: what counts as “yes/no,”
      what counts as “stop,” and what the interaction is claimed to mean within the frame.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Activation pressure (∇) pushes toward enactment and closure before frame clarity (□) and
      stop-capability (Χ) are secured; urgency can outrun coordination.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "A pause, hesitation, or withdrawal occurs but is treated as ambiguous or unacceptable."
      - "A clarification request does not occur, or is discouraged/deflected."
      - "A boundary signal is not acknowledged as a valid interrupt."
      - "Repair / integration talk is deferred while enactment proceeds."

  operator_mapping:

    reduced_signature: "MF_12_2 (as full-chain orientation) + viability corridor emphasis on □/Ω/Θ/Χ (+Σ reachable)"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        The consent-relevant frame requires explicitness: what is permitted, what counts as refusal,
        what counts as stopping, and what is out of scope. Frame ambiguity raises drift risk.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Identify gradients separately (access, exposure, dependency, obligation, leverage). Consent validity
        requires Ω to be nameable and regulable within □, not denied or moralized.
      theta_temporality: >
        Treat consequences as trajectory-real: repetition, accumulation, after-effects, and irreversibility windows.
        Exit realism is part of validity; “local scenes” can still count across Θ.
      lambda_residue: >
        Non-events (silence, pause, refusal, withdrawal) must be structurally tolerable. If Λ becomes steering
        (punishment/leverage), consent-talk degrades.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Repetition can stabilize scripts that silently govern what is “normal,” reducing alternatives and raising path dependence.
        A stabilizing script can substitute for explicit coordination.
      recontext_phi: >
        Reframing can either restore clarity or mask costs; repeated “it was different” narratives may substitute for Σ.
      integration_sigma: >
        Integration is the ability to coordinate contradictions (desire vs hesitation, pace mismatch, boundary mismatch)
        without coercive simplification. If Σ is unreachable, stability is often bought by displacement.
      binding_psi: >
        Consent claims are invalidated when binding/meaning demands (Ψ) enter covertly (Ψ leak), especially when the scene
        is narrated as “non-binding” or “not that serious” while identity-relevant stakes are implicitly imported.
      distance_chi: >
        Distance is the practical availability of stopping and meta-position inside the scene. If Χ is priced or punished,
        validity collapses even if consent language is present.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signatures are shorthand only. In PMS, Χ presupposes Φ, Θ, and □; Σ presupposes Χ and Φ; Ψ presupposes Σ, Θ, and Χ.
      Shorthand does not waive prerequisites.

        title: "Linear operator spine (canonical flow)"
        formula: "Δ → ∇ → □ → Λ → Α → Ω → Θ → Φ → Χ → Σ → Ψ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Used as an orientation map to keep the consent analysis grounded in operator order:
          consent validity must be read as a configuration property across Ω/Θ/Χ, not as a single local utterance.
      - signature_id: "D_min_formula_ch21_3"
        title: "Minimal formula of D (overlay enactment constraint)"
        formula: "D = explicit Ω + operative Χ + no covert Ψ demand under Θ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Used as a validity constraint: consent under asymmetry requires explicit handling of Ω, real stop-capability (Χ),
          and absence of covert binding/meaning demands (Ψ leak) as the carrier of stakes across Θ.
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "core_dysfunction_markers_ch18_3/(1) Covert self-binding demand (Ψ leak)"
        label: "Covert self-binding demand (Ψ leak)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Consent is narrated as local/non-binding while implicit meaning, exclusivity, or identity-relevant stakes enter the scene.
          This produces silent binding pressure without frame support.
      - drift_id: "core_dysfunction_markers_ch18_3/(2) Asymmetry escalation (Ω escalation)"
        label: "Asymmetry escalation (Ω escalation)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Access/pace/boundary pressure increases without explicit rule updates; Ω becomes a steering variable rather than a managed gradient.
      - drift_id: "core_dysfunction_markers_ch18_3/(4) Non-event escalation (Λ as steering)"
        label: "Non-event escalation (Λ as steering)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Pauses, hesitations, or refusals function as leverage points; absence becomes instrumentally active and increases interpretive overload.
      - drift_id: "core_dysfunction_markers_ch18_3/(6) Loss of distance (Χ loss)"
        label: "Loss of distance (Χ loss)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Stopping becomes practically unavailable or punished; critique/hesitation is treated as betrayal, collapsing meta-position.
      - drift_id: "core_dysfunction_markers_ch18_3/(7) Temporal overload (Θ accumulation)"
        label: "Temporal overload (Θ accumulation)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Costs accumulate faster than the frame can carry; exit realism degrades and “you can stop anytime” becomes an exit fiction.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      The SEX overlay supplies consent-domain drift markers, viability corridors, and shorthand signatures that discipline
      what a consent claim can mean under Ω/Θ/Λ pressure and Χ pricing. PMS core alone can represent the structure, but the
      overlay adds a consent-specific validity vocabulary that prevents sliding from description into permission.

    observable_markers:
      - "Ω gradients are not nameable within □ (pseudo-symmetry rhetoric substitutes for regulation)."
      - "Χ is asserted verbally but not practically available (stop is priced/punished)."
      - "Λ events (pause/withdrawal) trigger pressure, punishment, or interpretive leverage."
      - "Ψ-relevant meaning is imported covertly into a frame narrated as non-binding."
      - "Θ accumulation is denied via local reset narratives despite persistent costs."

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Map exposure and leverage gradients without moralization: who carries bodily risk, reputational downside, social fallout,
      dependency costs, and opportunity costs; who controls pace, access, and definition of “normal” inside the frame.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Identify accumulation channels (after-effects, repetition, documentation/publicness overlays, relationship consequences),
      and how they narrow reversibility windows; note where exit realism is replaced by “local reset” narratives.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Identify unresolved non-events (unacknowledged boundaries, unprocessed withdrawal, unsaid conditions) and how they continue
      to shape behavior through guessing, monitoring, or leverage dynamics.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Avoid naming Ω if naming Ω is punished within □ (pseudo-symmetry as stability substitute)."
      - "Proceed under ambiguity when ∇ pressure is high and Χ is costly, to avoid immediate conflict."
      - "Use Φ (reframing) to reduce tension when Σ (integration) is practically unavailable."
      - "Rely on scripts (Α) when explicit negotiation increases exposure or retaliation risk."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      The dignity risk point occurs when asymmetry (Ω) and temporality (Θ) are real, but stopping (Χ) is priced/punished and
      consent talk is used to override boundary signals or to import covert binding (Ψ leak).
    structural_indicator: >
      A dignity-in-practice collapse indicator is present when the configuration cannot tolerate refusal/withdrawal (Λ) without
      coercive pressure or devaluation, and when the stop-capability (Χ) is non-operative in practice.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No claims about inner desire, intent, pathology, or character."
      - "No legal or clinical conclusions; no culpability determination."
      - "No advice or scripts for sexual conduct; no enforcement guidance."
      - "No global person labels or irreversible identity attribution."
    claimed:
      - "Consent under asymmetry is a configuration-validity property, not a single utterance or internal state."
      - "Validity requires □ explicitness, Ω nameability/regulability, Θ realism, Λ tolerance, and operative Χ."
      - "Drift risk is structurally prepared by Ψ leak, Ω-as-steering, Λ-as-steering, Χ loss, and Θ accumulation."
      - "MIP is mandatory to protect D0 and to constrain artifact misuse corridors."
    misuse_warning: >
      This case output must not be used to shame, rank, expose, coerce, or force irreversible attributions.
      It must not be converted into “permission,” “proof,” or “enforcement” logic. Any such use is invalid under PMS.

  structural_closure: >
    Consent under asymmetry is structurally valid only when the scene frame (□) can carry explicit boundaries and stopping,
    asymmetry (Ω) is nameable and regulable rather than denied, temporality (Θ) is treated as real (no exit fictions),
    non-events (Λ) are tolerable without leverage dynamics, and distance (Χ) is practically available before escalation hardens.
    Drift preparation occurs when Ω becomes a steering variable, Χ is priced, Λ becomes instrumental, and Ψ-relevant stakes
    enter covertly into a frame that cannot support binding.

  plain_language_summary: >
    This case treats consent as something a situation has to be able to carry, not as a single word or moment.
    When one side has more leverage or the other carries more risk, consent-talk stays meaningful only if boundaries are clear,
    stopping is actually possible, time and after-effects are treated as real, and hesitation or withdrawal can happen without
    punishment or pressure. If “consent” is used while stopping is effectively unavailable, costs are denied, or hidden meaning
    demands are imported, the configuration becomes drift-prepared and the consent label no longer functions as a reliable
    description of what is happening.
