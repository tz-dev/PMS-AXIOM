    context: >
      Responsibility and evaluation pressures arise when outcomes differ due to factors
      outside an agent’s control (chance events, environmental contingencies, systemic exposure),
      even when intentions or local decisions appear similar. The case is treated structurally:
      attribution regimes under asymmetry and temporality, not moral psychology.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        The moral-luck question is constrained to how responsibility-attribution (R-like structures)
        is stabilized within explicit frames (□) under outcome variance (Δ) and exposure gradients (Ω),
        across time (Θ). No claim is made about ultimate moral desert.
      protected_constraints:
        - "Structural mapping only; no person-ranking or moral verdict delivery"
        - "Attribution must be explicitly framed (□) and scene-bound"
        - "Outcome variance and exposure are treated as structural inputs (Δ/Ω), not as character evidence"
        - "Reversibility applies: attributions are revisable under Φ, unless legitimately self-bound (Ψ)"
        - "Dignity-in-practice (D) constrains how outcomes may be used to shame or fix persons"
      out_of_frame:
        - "Ultimate desert claims independent of frames"
        - "Psychological trait inference from outcomes"
        - "Global, irreversible moral labels about persons"
        - "Metaphysical claims about luck as an ontological force"

    temporality:
      time_scale: "single event to long-horizon trajectories (Θ)"
      iteration_rhythm: "repeated attribution cycles after outcomes and counterfactual comparisons"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "institutional record-keeping and precedent effects (□-stability over Θ)"
        - "path dependence from early attributions (Σ→Ψ lock-in)"
        - "repeated exposure to contingent risks (Ω over Θ)"
      reversibility_window: >
        Responsibility attributions may be revised when the frame changes (Φ), when counterfactual
        structure becomes visible (Λ), or when integration criteria (Σ) are updated. Hard reversals
        are constrained once explicit commitments are legitimately bound (Ψ) within valid gates.

    roles:
      - role_label: "Agent (subject of attribution)"
        function: "Carrier of actions and commitments exposed to contingent outcomes"
        exposure_profile: "Outcome-exposed; bears costs under attribution regimes"
        notes: "Modelled structurally as Σ/Ψ over Θ under Ω exposure; not a moral essence."
      - role_label: "Attributors (peers / institutions / observers)"
        function: "Stabilize responsibility and evaluation within a frame"
        exposure_profile: "Often lower direct exposure; may impose durable labels (Ω advantage)"
        notes: "Their attribution authority and standards are part of Ω and must be framed (□) and bounded (Χ)."
      - role_label: "Affected parties"
        function: "Bear consequences of outcomes; generate pressure for closure"
        exposure_profile: "High exposure/cost; may demand stronger attribution closure"
        notes: "Their exposure is an Ω gradient that changes what closure demands arise."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Two structurally similar action sequences yield divergent outcomes due to contingencies:
      near-miss vs harm, lucky escape vs damage, timing differences, systemic variance.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Closure demand to align evaluation with outcomes: pressure to treat harmful outcomes as
      stronger evidence of fault, even when control structure appears comparable.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "The counterfactual 'would-have-happened' event remains structurally inaccessible (Λ)."
      - "A decisive criterion for responsibility independent of outcomes does not appear (Λ)."
      - "Expected fairness equivalence across agents does not materialize under Ω exposure gradients (Λ)."

    reduced_signature: "PMS_CORE_MORAL_LUCK_Omega_Theta_Lambda_Sigma_Psi"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        Moral luck is only legible within explicit attribution frames (□): legal, social, institutional,
        relational. The frame determines whether outcome, intention, foreseeability, or role-duty dominates.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Exposure gradients (Ω) are central: who bears harm, who bears blame, who has authority to attribute,
        and who has exit options. Outcome-based attribution often tracks Ω rather than control.
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ makes luck cumulative: repeated exposures, long-tail consequences, and precedent effects alter
        future attribution and commitment costs.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ is the counterfactual remainder: the near-miss that did not occur, the harm that could have happened,
        and the unreachable comparison baseline that closure demands but cannot deliver.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Α stabilizes attribution habits: outcome-weighting routines, reputational scripts, precedent loops,
        and institutional heuristics that repeat across cases.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ shifts frames: what counts as "the same act" changes across contexts (e.g., private vs public,
        professional vs informal), altering attribution rules mid-trajectory.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ integrates control-structure information (what was chosen, what was foreseeable) with outcome
        information (what happened) into a workable attribution regime, but remains frame-relative.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ binds agents and institutions to attribution commitments over time (e.g., responsibility stances,
        precedent, role duties), creating stability without claiming ultimate desert.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ prevents outcome-to-essence slides: reflective distance blocks totalizing conclusions from harm,
        and keeps attribution scene-bound and revisable.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      PMS-only case. Operator order is canonical; the practical closure pressure (∇) emerges from Δ under □,
      with Λ counterfactual residue stabilized into Α/Ω/Θ trajectories. Σ/Ψ are treated as frame-relative
      integration and binding, invalid if Χ/reversibility/D are suspended.

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Outcome burdens are unevenly distributed: affected parties carry direct harm; agents may carry blame;
      institutions may externalize risk while retaining attribution authority; observers may be insulated.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Once an attribution becomes institutionalized (Σ→Ψ), it hardens into precedent and reputation, raising
      future cost of revision and increasing path dependence across time.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Residue load is high: counterfactual comparisons are structurally demanded but not deliverable; near-miss
      structure persists as tension; multiple Σ integrations remain admissible under the same history.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Declare the attribution frame (□) explicitly (legal vs relational vs institutional)."
      - "Separate outcome-exposure (Ω) from control-structure where possible; do not treat harm as essence."
      - "Preserve Λ counterfactual residue (near-miss structure) instead of laundering closure."
      - "Use Χ to keep attributions scene-bound, revisable, and non-totalizing."
      - "Allow Φ-driven revision when context changes; track Θ path dependence of precedents and reputations."
      - "Bind (Ψ) only those commitments that can be justified within valid gates (Χ + reversibility + D)."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Outcome-weighted attribution can collapse into shaming or irreversible labeling, especially when
      high harm triggers urgency and institutions hold strong Ω authority.
    structural_indicator: >
      Closure-overreach pattern: Σ integration is treated as authoritative essence; Λ counterfactual residue
      is suppressed; Χ becomes costly or absent; outcome severity becomes a proxy for person-worth.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No ultimate theory of moral desert is provided."
      - "No psychological claims about intention, character, or guilt are inferred."
      - "No universal rule is given for when outcome should dominate responsibility."
      - "No enforcement or punitive guidance is implied."
    claimed:
      - "Moral luck is a structural closure-demand triggered by Δ outcome variance under Ω exposure gradients across Θ."
      - "Λ counterfactual residue (near-miss / unrealized alternatives) is irreducible and must remain explicit."
      - "Practical attribution regimes can be modelled as Σ integrations that may become Ψ bindings within frames (□)."
      - "Boundary statements and a taxonomy of attribution modes are deliverable at PMS-only level."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use this case to justify moral ranking, humiliation, or irreversible person labeling. Outputs here
      are structural artefacts for making attribution frames and residues explicit, not verdicts about people.

  structural_closure: >
    PMS reframes moral luck as a structural conflict between outcome variance (Δ) and responsibility closure
    demands under exposure gradients (Ω) across time (Θ). Counterfactual comparison baselines remain Λ residues.
    Attribution regimes are Σ integrations within explicit frames (□) that may harden into Ψ commitments over Θ.
    Output type: taxonomy of attribution modes (outcome-weighted vs control-weighted vs role-duty-weighted) and
    boundary statements identifying where further closure is not structurally deliverable.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Moral luck happens when similar choices lead to very different outcomes, and people feel pressure to judge
    the agent differently because harm occurred. This case treats that pressure as a structural feature of how
    responsibility is assigned inside specific contexts. Some “what would have happened” comparisons can never
    be fully known, so uncertainty remains. The goal is to make that residue explicit and prevent outcome-based
    judgments from turning into shaming or irreversible labels.
