        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can represent Δ/□/Λ/Α and how Ω/Θ shape trajectories, but it does not
          discipline boundary work in sexual praxis as a high-misuse domain where frame ambiguity
          (□ drift), non-events (Λ), and stop-capability (Χ) collapse can be laundered as “normal confusion.”
          The SEX overlay supplies drift markers (□ ambiguity drift; Λ as steering; Χ loss; Ψ leak),
          and viability corridors that keep boundary questions structural (configuration-validity),
          not moralized or converted into proof/permission logic.

        why_this_addon: >
          Boundary and consent-adjacent analyses are high-risk for weaponization, exposure, and
          person-labeling. MIP is mandatory to enforce D0 discipline: keep critique scene-bound,
          reversible, dignity-constrained, and non-enforcement. This case authorizes no sanction,
          humiliation, or publicness escalation.

    context: >
      A sexual interaction is narrated as “unclear” or “mixed signals,” with boundaries
      shifting in-the-moment or retroactively. Consent language may appear, but the frame
      (□) does not stably specify what counts as “yes/no/stop,” what escalation steps require
      renewed explicitness, or how hesitation is handled. The analysis targets boundary legibility,
      stop-capability, and meaning containment as configuration properties under Ω/Θ.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Boundaries are a frame property: the scene is valid only if □ makes “inside/outside,”
        “allowed/forbidden,” “stop,” and “renegotiate” legible enough that Λ (pauses, hesitation,
        non-response) can occur without coercive reinterpretation, and Χ (distance/stop) remains
        practically available under Ω/Θ.
      protected_constraints:
        - "Scene-bound, reversible reading only (no global person claims)."
        - "No advice, persuasion scripts, or operational instructions."
        - "D constraint: no shaming, ranking, humiliation, or person-typing."
        - "MIP mandatory: no exposure, naming, or enforcement logic."
        - "Boundaries treated as □/Λ/Χ/Σ carriers, not as moral virtues."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Legal culpability or forensic determinations."
        - "Psychological diagnosis or motive interpretation."
        - "Public accusation, naming, or documentation-as-verdict."
        - "Consent-as-proof or consent-as-absolution logic."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "minutes to weeks (single encounter; may repeat into a script)"
      iteration_rhythm: "episodic; may become recurring with stabilized ambiguity"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "Λ residues accumulate (unresolved hesitation, unanswered questions)."
        - "Α stabilizes an ambiguity-script (“we’re just bad at boundaries”)."

        - "Φ narrative repair substitutes for clarification (“that’s just how we are”)."
      reversibility_window: >
        Highest early (before scripts stabilize). Shrinks when stop/clarify attempts (Χ)
        are priced, when ambiguity is normalized as default (Α), and when Θ costs accumulate.

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      A mismatch between what each party treats as boundary-relevant distinctions:
      (play vs serious; flirt vs commitment; pause vs refusal; escalation threshold;
      “stop” semantics; what needs explicit renewal).
    nabla_impulse: >
      Pressure to proceed/escalate faster than the frame can maintain clarity,

      - "Pauses/hesitation are not tolerated as neutral (Λ becomes interpretive pressure)."

    reduced_signature: >
      BOUNDARY_CONFUSION = Δ(unclear distinctions) ∘ □(ambiguous) ∘ Λ(dense) ∘ Α(scripted ambiguity)
      under Ω/Θ with Χ weak and Σ low; Ψ leak risk if meaning binds covertly.
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        □ is unstable or ambiguous: boundaries are implicit, shifting, retroactively rewritten,
        or split across competing micro-frames (“it’s play” vs “it counts”).
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Ω gradients (access, pace-control, exposure, reputational/bodily cost) are present but
        not regulable inside □; pseudo-symmetry talk may function as a lid.
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ makes boundary errors accumulate: after-effects, trust erosion, documentation,
        and repetition harden ambiguity into a trajectory even if narrated as “local.”
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ increases interpretive load: hesitation, silence, delayed replies, and missing repair
        become structurally active; if treated as signals to override, Λ becomes steering.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Α stabilizes “confusion” as a repeatable script; ambiguity becomes normal and thus
        harder to interrupt, narrowing alternatives.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ can restore clarity (reframe to explicit rules) or mask costs (narrative substitution:
        “we just communicate differently”), producing Φ-only stabilization.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ is the validity hinge: if stopping/clarifying is socially or practically costly,
        boundary confusion becomes drift-prepared.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ is low when contradictions remain uncoordinated (mixed frames persist), leading to
        compensatory stability via scripts, avoidance, or narrative repair rather than explicit rule synthesis.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ leak risk: meaning/obligation enters covertly (“this proves trust/closeness/commitment”)
        despite frame ambiguity; later disputes become identity-relevant without carrier support.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signatures are shorthand. Canonical PMS dependencies remain authoritative:
      Χ presupposes Φ/Θ/□; Σ presupposes Χ/Φ; Ψ presupposes Σ/Θ/Χ.

        how_it_applies_here: >
          Keeps boundary confusion legible as a full-chain failure mode: ambiguity at □ generates Λ density,
          which stabilizes as Α, becomes risky under Ω/Θ, and collapses correction when Χ/Σ are weak.

    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      SEX makes boundary confusion readable as a drift corridor (□ ambiguity → Λ density → Α script → Ω/Θ risk),
      and supplies concrete invalidity markers (Χ priced; Λ steering; Ψ leak) to prevent moralization or
      consent-as-token reduction. MIP constrains critique legitimacy and blocks misuse (D0).

  drift_classification:

    drift_label: "Boundary confusion via □ ambiguity + Λ density under Ω/Θ with Χ weak"
    minimal_drift_signature: >
      Δ unclear + □ ambiguous/retroactive + Λ dense → Α stabilized ambiguity under Ω/Θ,
      with Χ priced and Σ low; Ψ leak risk increases with Θ accumulation.
    observable_markers:
      - "Boundaries are described as ‘obvious’ but cannot be stated consistently."
      - "Stopping/clarifying triggers pressure, devaluation, or escalation."
      - "Hesitation is reinterpreted as ‘playing hard to get’ or ‘mixed signals.’"
      - "After discomfort, repair is replaced by narrative minimization (Φ-only)."
      - "Meaning claims appear later despite earlier ‘it doesn’t mean anything’ framing."

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Uneven cost-bearing: one role controls pace/interpretation while the other bears higher bodily,
      relational, or reputational consequence. If Ω is unspeakable inside □, boundary work is replaced
      by guessing and compliance pressure.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Repetition converts confusion into a trajectory: trust erodes, after-effects accumulate, and
      reversibility shrinks. Documentation/publicness overlays can harden Θ costs further.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Accumulated non-events: missing clarifications, unaddressed discomfort, delayed repair, and
      unacknowledged stopping attempts. Λ residue increases interpretive overload and drift pressure.

  rational_response_envelope:

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Boundary confusion is maintained by making stop/clarify socially costly while invoking
      symmetry rhetoric, turning hesitation into a trigger for pressure or reinterpretation.
    structural_indicator: >
      Χ priced + Ω unspeakable + Λ steering; Σ remains low and Φ substitutes for coordination;
      Ψ-relevant meaning enters covertly as Θ accumulates.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, exposure, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No claims about intent, character, pathology, or ‘who is at fault.’"
      - "No legal determination of consent or wrongdoing."
      - "No permission/proof logic (‘they said X so it’s fine’ / ‘they didn’t say X so it’s not’)."
      - "No enforcement, sanction, or exposure guidance."
    claimed:
      - "Boundary clarity is a □ property; confusion is structurally diagnosable as frame instability."
      - "Under Ω/Θ, ambiguous boundaries predict Λ residue, script stabilization (Α), and shrinking reversibility."
      - "Validity requires operative Χ (real stop/clarify) and reachable Σ (coordination of mismatched frames)."
      - "Ψ leak risk rises when meaning binds covertly despite unresolved □ ambiguity."
      - "MIP is mandatory to constrain critique and prevent misuse (D0 relevance)."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not weaponize this case as a person-label or a public accusation template.
      Keep analysis scene-bound, reversible, and dignity-constrained; do not convert structural markers
      into verdicts, sanctions, or exposure demands.

  structural_closure: >
    Boundary confusion is a frame failure mode: Δ distinctions that should define “stop,” escalation thresholds,
    and what counts as consent-relevant signals are not stabilized in □, producing Λ density and interpretive overload.
    Repetition stabilizes ambiguity as Α, which becomes risky under Ω/Θ because costs accumulate while stopping (Χ) is
    practically weakened. Viability improves only when □ becomes explicit, Ω is speakable, Χ is operative, and Σ can
    coordinate mismatched expectations without coercion; drift increases when Φ-only narratives replace integration
    and meaning binds covertly (Ψ leak) across Θ.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Boundary confusion isn’t “just miscommunication.” It’s when a situation can’t clearly support what counts as
    yes/no/stop and what needs clarification before going further. Then pauses and hesitation stop being neutral,
    and people start guessing or pushing instead of coordinating. If stopping or asking questions is costly, the
    confusion becomes a repeatable script, and the effects build up over time—even if everyone keeps saying
    “it’s fine.”
