    secondary_material: ""
    assumptions_and_inferences: |
      - Pattern-level structural reading only (no concrete transcript, institution, or real-person case material provided).
      - The PMS “fork marker” is treated as a viability gate: repair remains viable only if Χ (pause/stop) is practically usable
        without penalty and Φ remains revisable (not an enforcement channel) under Θ and Ω.
      - IA-box (T/J/TB/R) is treated as a structural check for whether “priced/asymmetric Χ” drifts into problematic asymmetry:
        non-transparent pricing, missing justification, no time bounds, and/or irreversibility under Ω/Θ.
      - Responsibility (M) is role- and constraint-dependent; no person-level attribution is intended.
    quality_and_limits:
      coverage_estimate: "medium"
      reliability_estimate: "medium"
      known_gaps:
        - "No concrete vignette/transcript; pattern-level only."
        - "Domain context unspecified (private vs workplace vs institutional vs media-amplified), thus publicity and enforcement levers are underspecified."
        - "No explicit mapping of real pause/exit availability (Χ), retaliation costs, or who controls timing/visibility under Ω."
        - "No explicit evidence of which repair protocols, review windows, or reversal pathways exist (TB/R)."
      main_bias_risks_here:
        - "frame_bias (treating fork dynamics as inherent rather than context-dependent)"
        - "selection_bias (using a paradigmatic description without counter-examples)"
        - "hindsight_bias (reading Θ-hardening as inevitable rather than contingent)"

  snapshot:
    short_case_description: |
      A coupled interaction oscillates between attempted repair and episodes of escalation. Over time (Θ), absences and delays
      accumulate as residue (Λ), and attractors (Α) may stabilize either toward repair or toward escalation. The decisive structural
      variable is whether stop-capability (Χ) is usable symmetrically and whether recontextualization (Φ) remains revisable rather
      than becoming an exposure/enforcement channel under asymmetry (Ω). Central drift risk: converting structural legibility into
      blame, diagnosis, or coercive settlement demands.

      - "R1_Position_A"
      - "R2_Position_B"
      - "R3_Third_Parties_optional"
    guiding_question: |
      Under what conditions does the repair corridor remain viable (usable Χ + revisable Φ + sufficient shared Σ under Ψ),
      and under what conditions does escalation become a stabilized attractor (Α_conflict) because Χ is priced/asymmetric under Ω/Θ
      and Φ drifts into substitution/exposure capture?

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: |
      - Persistent coupling with stakes (Ψ>0): repeated contact and obligation continuity.
      - Temporality (Θ): path dependence, record coupling, shrinking revision windows.
      - Asymmetry (Ω): unequal exposure/liability/exit costs; potential control over timing/visibility.
      - Residue (Λ): non-acknowledgments/delays becoming load-bearing under Ω/Θ.
      - Validity gate: preserve stop-capability (Χ), reversibility, and dignity constraints (D0 untouched; no person labels).
    variable_elements: |
      - Domain context (private/workplace/institutional/media-amplified) and the associated enforcement levers.
      - Whether repair protocols exist: protected pauses (Χ), clear rules for acknowledgments, and revision-friendly Φ practices.
      - Whether publicity/records are minimized vs amplified; whether third parties stabilize repair or stabilize escalation.
      - Whether “closure pressure” is time-bounded and justified vs indefinite and coercive.
      - Whether obligations (Ψ) can be renegotiated or time-bounded; whether review windows exist (TB).
    unfair_high_M_zones: |
      - Roles with near-zero alternatives and high retaliation risk under Ω (dependency, institutional coercion).
      - Contexts where publicity/records are imposed and reversibility is structurally blocked under Θ.
      - Situations where “pause” is socially or procedurally punishable, making χ-availability effectively unavailable.
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: |
      - "Escalation is inevitable here" used to refuse minimum protections for Χ, reversibility, and dignity constraints.
      - "Repair is always possible if you try" used to deny Ω gradients and the real pricing of χ and contestability.
      - "They are the escalator / the mature one" used to convert fork-legibility into person-level labels or sanctions.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: |
        Each position may know its own constraints and triggers well, but have partial knowledge of the other side’s
        cost structure, exposure profile, and the practical pricing of Χ under Ω. Third parties may know rules/records
        but treat frames as self-evident, collapsing alternative readings.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: |
        Oscillation between repair and escalation; repeated non-convergence despite attempts at clarification;
        closure pressure escalating; Λ residue (delays/non-acknowledgments) functioning as leverage; Φ moves
        increasing exposure rather than reopening revision.
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: |
        Treating “pause” (Χ) as betrayal; confusing repair effort with guaranteed repair viability; ignoring how Ω
        shapes whose delays or withdrawals are costly; confusing visibility/exposure with truth or justification.
    coherence:
      official_narratives: |
        "We should repair." "We should hold accountable." "We must resolve this." "The record proves it."
      visible_enactments: |
        Episodes → attempted repair → partial reset → re-trigger; Φ clarifications that sometimes bridge and sometimes
        harden; increasing reliance on records/third parties; escalation moves under publicity; stabilization of either
        a repair attractor or an escalation attractor (Α).
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: |
        Coherence can remain locally high while joint coherence varies by corridor: repair requires revisable Φ and usable
        Χ; escalation corridor can remain coherent as a “settlement drive” even while it collapses reversibility and dignity.
    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: |
        - Making χ availability explicit: define pause/timeout rules and prohibit punishment for taking distance (Χ + reversibility).
        - Keeping Φ revisable: distinguish clarification from verdict production; prevent scope creep into enforcement.
        - Naming Ω gradients: who pays the costs of delay, publicity, and record coupling; who controls timing/visibility.
        - Time-bounding closure pressure: review windows, staged trials, explicit criteria for continuing repair attempts (TB).
        - Preventing conversion of fork-legibility into person-level blame, diagnosis, or coercive exposure.
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: |
        Responsibility can drift into (i) escalation-as-accountability (settlement demand), or (ii) repair-as-demand
        (pressuring the other to repair without protecting Χ and Φ conditions). It can also be displaced into third-party
        record authority under Ω/Θ.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: |
        If repair corridors collapse, escalation stabilizes as attractor: increased exposure, hardened narratives, narrowing
        options, and greater dignity risk. Third parties may be drawn into enforcement-by-audience dynamics unless their role
        is explicitly bounded to de-escalation and reversibility protection.
    power:
      formal_power_distribution: |
        Domain-dependent. If third parties are institutional/platform-based, formal levers (rules, records, moderation,
        sanctions) can enforce visibility and settlement. In private contexts, dependency can function as informal enforcement.
      factual_power_distribution: |
        Control over timing, visibility, and record coupling can be a power gradient. Ability to delay, withdraw, or demand
        settlement can become asymmetrical; χ-pricing under Ω/Θ is decisive for corridor selection.
      used_alternatives: |
        - Repair attempts (Σ) with varying Φ strategies (clarification, reframing)
        - Escalation moves via exposure and record expansion
        - Delay/non-acknowledgment (Λ) as leverage under Θ/Ω
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: |
        - Protected pause protocols (Χ) with explicit non-punitive rules
        - Explicit asymmetry mapping and contestability protections (Ω transparency)
        - Time-bounded trials/review cycles (TB) to prevent Θ-hardening
        - Separation of structural description from governance/enforcement mode
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: |
        D module remains OFF. Dignity risk is handled structurally: main risk is person-totalization, shaming/ranking,
        and coercive exposure when escalation stabilizes under Ω/Θ and χ becomes contested or punished.

  ia_protection:
    transparency_measures: |
      - Make frames explicit (□): distinguish repair intent from enforcement intent; define what counts as acknowledgment, repair action, and escalation.
      - Make χ explicit: define pause/timeout/withdrawal rules and prohibit punishing χ as betrayal or defection.
      - Name Ω: map exposure, liability, timing/visibility control, and record/publicness coupling costs for each role position.
    time_bound_measures: |
      - Introduce time-bounded experiments (TB): limited trials, review checkpoints, and explicit criteria for continuing repair attempts.
      - Prevent Θ-hardening by scheduling review windows rather than crisis-driven settlement demands.
    reversibility_measures: |
      - Maintain usable pause/exit pathways with low retaliation cost (R).
      - Avoid durable-record escalation when it would collapse reversibility; separate private repair from public record-building.

        short_description: "Early cycles: repair is still feasible; χ protocols can be defined; Φ remains revisable; reversibility is relatively high."
        A_band_at_t: "A ≈ 5–7/10"
        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 3–7/10 (higher for roles shaping pause rules and publicity/records)"
      - label: "t1"
        short_description: "Oscillation stabilizes: Λ residue accumulates; closure pressure rises; attractor competition becomes salient (repair vs escalation)."
        A_band_at_t: "A ≈ 4–6/10"

        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 4–9/10 (highest where visibility/records/enforcement were controlled or designed)"
    course_in_words: |
      The pattern often moves from negotiable repair attempts into repeated oscillations where residue accumulates and closure pressure increases.
      If χ is protected and Φ remains revisable, repair can stabilize as attractor; if χ is priced/asymmetric and publicity/records harden Θ,
      escalation becomes structurally rational and self-stabilizing.
    responsibility_viability_range: |
      Viability increases when χ is symmetric and non-punitive, Φ is revisable, and attempts are time-bounded with review windows.
      Viability collapses when settlement demand replaces contestability, χ is priced asymmetrically, and public/record coupling hardens Θ.

  open_questions_and_blind_spots:
    unclear_points: |
      - Which domain is intended (private relationship, workplace, institutional governance, media-amplified conflict)?
      - Who controls timing/visibility/record coupling, and how is χ (pause/exit) practically priced under Ω?
      - Are there any explicit repair protocols, review windows (TB), or reversal mechanisms (R), or is Θ-hardening unmanaged?
    missing_data_or_perspectives: |
      - Concrete vignette/transcript showing how χ requests are handled and how Φ shifts (bridge vs substitution) occur.
      - Mapping of publicity and durable records: what is stored, who can amplify, and how reversibility is affected.
      - At least one counter-example where protected χ and TB reviews stabilized repair rather than escalation.
    distortion_risks: |
      - Overgeneralizing escalation as inevitable rather than corridor-dependent.
      - Underestimating tragedy clause: some collisions of goods persist even under high maturity.
      - Misreading structural description as authorization for blame, diagnosis, or public prosecution.

  biases_case_level:
    initial_intuition: |
      The fork between repair and escalation is governed less by intent and more by corridor conditions: if χ is usable and Φ is revisable, repair can stabilize;
      if χ is priced and records/publicness harden Θ, escalation becomes rational and self-sustaining.

      - "confirmation_bias"
      - "hindsight_bias"
      - "status_quo_bias"
      - "halo_effect"
    counter_reading_outline: |
      Counter-reading: what looks like a structural escalation attractor may be contingent on missing process design. If explicit χ protocols, time-bounded review windows,
      and a rule separating clarification (Φ) from verdict production were introduced early, repair might stabilize and escalation might not become self-sustaining. The
      decisive variable is the real distribution of alternatives and the cost of pauses/exits under Ω.

  analyst_reflection:
    self_implication_notes: |
      Describing a pattern as “escalation attractor” can be misused as a rhetorical weapon to delegitimize protest or accountability. This file therefore treats the fork
      as conditional and corridor-dependent, foregrounding reversibility, χ protections, and strict separation of structural description from person evaluation.
    possible_next_steps: |
      - Add a concrete vignette and map who controlled timing, visibility, and χ pricing at each timepoint.
      - Specify domain and publicity level; re-check IA box T/J/TB/R with real protocols and costs.
      - Add 1–2 counter-examples where protected χ and TB reviews stabilized repair and reduced residue accumulation.

  uniform_report:
    title: "Praxeological analysis of a practice pattern: Escalation vs repair fork under coupling"
    one_paragraph_overview: |
      This reading describes a recurring interaction in which repair attempts and escalation episodes compete over time. The decisive issue is not who is right,
      but whether the situation still supports a real pause or step-back without penalty and whether interpretations can be revised rather than turned into durable
      public verdicts. When pauses become punished or unevenly available and records or publicity harden the history, escalation can become the stable pattern.
      The analysis stays structural: it does not label persons, and it treats conclusions as revisable and corridor-dependent.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Repair remains viable when both sides can pause without punishment and interpretations stay revisable rather than enforcement-like."
      - "Escalation stabilizes when pauses are contested or unevenly available and exposure or records harden the trajectory over time."
      - "Missing acknowledgments and delayed actions can accumulate and become leverage material, reinforcing recurring cycles."
      - "The main safeguard is to keep descriptions reversible and role-bound, preventing conversion into blame, diagnosis, or public prosecution."
    maturity_summary: |
      In terms of maturity in practice, the pattern can contain strong local coherence while remaining mixed on shared responsibility and stable joint coordination under time and asymmetry pressure.
    ia_box_summary: |
      Structurally, asymmetry risk increases when pausing, withdrawing, or contesting becomes non-transparent, not time-bounded, or effectively irreversible for one side.
    dignity_summary: ""
    trajectory_summary: |
      Over time, the case often develops from negotiable repair attempts into repeated oscillations and then into hardened trajectories where revision becomes costly and escalation pressure intensifies.
    open_questions_summary: |
      Important open questions are the intended domain and publicity context, the real pricing of pause and exit options for each role, and whether review windows and reversal pathways exist in practice.
    conclusion: |
      In sum, the model suggests that repair versus escalation is a structural fork governed by the availability of protected pauses, revisable interpretation practices, and the management of time and exposure costs.
      For practice design, make pause rules explicit, keep interpretation revisable, time-bound closure pressure, and maintain language discipline so structural legibility does not become a weapon.
