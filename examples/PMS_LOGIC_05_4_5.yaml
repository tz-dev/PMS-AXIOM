        why_this_addon: >
          PMS-core models frames, non-events, and stabilized practices, but it does not
          by itself formalize the logic-level gap in which a rule-text fails to fix a
          unique continuation. LOGIC adds boundary-management signatures (carrying Λ
          without forced closure) and drift visibility (Σ-totalization, Ω-inflation,
          □-overconstraint) typical in attempts to "solve" the paradox by fiat.

    context: >
      Meaning and correctness attribution in practices that claim to be governed by
      rules (mathematics, law, programming, instruction-following, institutional
      procedures). A finite rule-expression is treated as determining correct future
      applications; a skeptic challenges that any finite evidence is compatible with
      many incompatible continuations.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Rule-governed correctness inside an explicit justification regime: what counts
        as "following the rule", who decides disputes, and what evidence is admissible.
      protected_constraints:
        - "Rule-following is evaluated within frames (□), not as frame-free necessity."
        - "A rule-text is a representation; enactment occurs as situated practice."
        - "Non-closure (Λ) about unique continuation is admissible and must be carried."
        - "Distance (Χ) blocks authority laundering from coherence or consensus."
        - "Reversibility applies: interpretations remain revisable under Φ."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Psychological explanations of what agents 'really mean' internally."
        - "Metaphysical realism about rules as self-interpreting entities."
        - "Moral judgment of agents who disagree about application."
        - "Prescriptive governance guidance for adjudication or enforcement."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "Iterated application over time (seconds to years), across novel cases."
      iteration_rhythm: "Repeated use with occasional dispute spikes at boundary cases."
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "Training and habituation stabilize use (Α)."
        - "Artifacts and records (examples, precedents, test suites) persist across time (Θ)."
        - "Institutional embedding of interpretive norms (Ψ at system level)."
      reversibility_window: >
        High while cases are local and standards can be revised; low when interpretations
        are locked-in as unquestionable doctrine or enforcement policy.
    roles:
      - role_label: "R1: Performer / Follower"
        function: "Applies the rule in concrete cases; enacts continuations."
        exposure_profile: "High exposure at novel cases; blamed for mismatch if Ω is steep."
        notes: "Structural role, not a person-description."
      - role_label: "R2: Attributor / Evaluator"
        function: "Assigns correctness; decides whether an application counts as 'following'."
        exposure_profile: "Variable; can externalize uncertainty downward under Ω."
        notes: "May be individual, community, or institution."
      - role_label: "R3: Rule-artifact / Standard"
        function: "Text, formula, code spec, precedent-set that anchors the frame."
        exposure_profile: "Low; treated as stable reference across cases."
        notes: "Carries representational closure pressure (∇) without guaranteeing uniqueness."
      - role_label: "R4: Adjudicating authority"
        function: "Resolves disputes; enforces interpretations; sets stopping points."
        exposure_profile: "High leverage; can inflate Ω by converting decisions into necessity."
        notes: "Not necessarily explicit; can be implicit social power."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Distinction between (i) a finite rule-expression / past training data and
      (ii) a uniquely determined correct continuation across unlimited future cases.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Closure pressure to treat the rule-text (or past examples) as fixing necessity:
      drive toward decisive correctness and eliminable ambiguity.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "No internal fact of the rule-text yields a unique continuation for all future inputs."
      - "No finite set of examples terminates interpretive underdetermination."
      - "No purely formal inference converts practice into necessity without remainder."

  operator_mapping:
    operator_chain: ["Ψ", "Σ", "Χ", "Φ", "Θ", "Ω", "Α", "Λ", "□", "∇", "Δ"]
    reduced_signature: "Δ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α  +  □ ∘ Λ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ  (+ Ω ∘ Θ ∘ Ψ as institutional embedding)"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        □ defines what counts as evidence of rule-following (examples, proofs,
        authoritative interpretations) and where disputes are admissible.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Ω appears when some roles can impose correctness labels (grading, courts,
        maintainers, experts). The paradox is amplified when authority substitutes
        for meaning-fixation.
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ extends rule-use into an open-ended future where novel cases arise; the
        paradox is structurally a temporality problem: future applications outrun
        finite specification.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ is the persistent remainder: the unique continuation event is absent.
        The gap is not a missing fact to discover inside the text; it is a structural
        non-closure within the evaluation frame.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Α stabilizes "how we go on" through repetition, pedagogy, exemplars, and
        shared routines, even when no unique formal continuation is available.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ operates when boundary cases force a reframing of the rule, the evidence
        standard, or the purpose of the practice (e.g., precedent updates, spec revisions).
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ integrates examples, purposes, and constraints into a coherent continuation
        policy. Σ is coordination within □, not a metaphysical guarantee of correctness.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ appears when communities or institutions bind themselves to continuation
        policies (standards, precedents, test suites), turning practice stability into
        identity/commitment across time.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ prevents converting coherent continuation (Σ) or stabilized practice (Α) into
        absolute authority. It keeps the interpretation revisable and scene-bound.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Attempts to secure "the" correct continuation by fiat typically bypass Φ (reframing)
      and suppress Χ (distance), forcing Σ into closure. Under PMS dependencies, such
      shortcuts are structurally expensive and show up as LOGIC-level drift risks.

        title: "Logical boundary management"
        formula: "□ ∘ Λ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Maintains the rule-under-determination remainder (Λ) while coordinating a
          workable continuation policy (Σ) inside an explicit evidence frame (□), with
          Χ preventing authority laundering.

        title: "Sustainable non-closure (boundary attractor)"
        formula: "Δ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Explains how practice can remain stable (Α) even though unique continuation
          does not materialize; stability is a pattern outcome, not a proof of necessity.
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "dogmatism_sigma_totalization"
        label: "Dogmatism (Σ-totalization)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Closure pressure invites treating a coherent continuation as the uniquely
          correct one, denying Λ and immunizing against revision.
      - drift_id: "authority_capture_omega_inflation"
        label: "Authority capture (Ω-inflation)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Dispute resolution can convert power gradients into meaning-fixation claims:
          "correct because decided by authority."
      - drift_id: "technocratic_reduction_frame_overconstraint"
        label: "Technocratic reduction (□-overconstraint)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Formal specifications are treated as exhaustive reality; unmodeled cases are
          dismissed or forced into the existing frame, generating brittle continuation.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      LOGIC makes explicit that the paradox is a boundary problem of correctness
      attribution: rule-text plus finite evidence cannot, by itself, deliver unique
      continuation. It provides a disciplined way to hold Λ while explaining the
      stabilizing role of Α/Ψ, and names the characteristic substitution drifts where
      coherence (Σ), authority (Ω), or narrow frames (□) masquerade as necessity.

      - "N/A (no concrete failure asserted; risks only)."

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Evaluators/adjudicators can externalize ambiguity costs to performers by issuing
      correctness labels without carrying Λ; performers bear rework and sanction risk.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Over time, exemplars and precedents harden into infrastructure (Α, Ψ), raising
      revision costs; late-stage Φ becomes politically and operationally expensive.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Persistent remainder: the missing unique continuation keeps generating boundary
      disputes and motivates periodic frame renegotiation.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Make the evidence frame (□) explicit and keep it revisable under Φ."
      - "Carry the non-closure (Λ) rather than forcing uniqueness by ad hoc closure."
      - "Use Χ to resist converting coherence/consensus into metaphysical necessity."
      - "Stabilize practice via exemplars (Α) while acknowledging their non-finality."
      - "Treat institutional commitments (Ψ) as policy stability, not as meaning-proof."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Correctness attribution becomes humiliation, exclusion, or coercive hierarchy,
      especially when Ω is steep and Λ is denied.
    structural_indicator: >
      Punitive enforcement of "the only correct meaning" while suppressing disputability;
      disagreement is treated as defect rather than as a boundary signal.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "A definitive solution to the rule-following paradox."
      - "A metaphysical theory of rules as self-interpreting entities."
      - "A psychological account of private meanings or intentions."
      - "A prescriptive institutional policy for adjudication or enforcement."
    claimed:
      - "Rule-following paradox expresses a structural non-closure (Λ) between finite rule-text and infinite continuation."
      - "Practice stability is explained by attractors (Α) and institutional self-binding (Ψ), not by unique formal necessity."
      - "LOGIC discipline is to coordinate continuations (Σ) inside explicit frames (□) while preserving revisability (Φ) and restraint (Χ)."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use this case to delegitimize agents, enforce epistemic hierarchy, or
      convert interpretive authority into moral or ontological ranking. Any use that
      suppresses Χ/reversibility/D is formally invalid as PMS application.

  structural_closure: >
    The rule-following paradox is re-specified as an open-ended temporality-driven
    underdetermination: finite rule representations do not fix unique future application.
    PMS explains stability through pattern formation (Α) and binding (Ψ) within frames
    (□), while PMS–LOGIC closes the analysis by carrying the remainder (Λ) and blocking
    substitution drifts in which Σ, □, or Ω are mistaken for necessity.

  plain_language_summary: >
    The paradox says: a written rule and a finite set of past examples never fully
    determine how to apply the rule in every future case. PMS–LOGIC treats that not as
    a failure of people, but as a real structural limit: meaning is stabilized by shared
    practice and commitments over time, while a residue of ambiguity remains. Keeping
    that limit explicit prevents coherence or authority from being mistaken for absolute
    correctness.
