    context: >
      An interpreter seeks understanding of a meaningful object (text, utterance, practice, artifact).
      Understanding proceeds iteratively: provisional sense of the whole shapes reading of parts, and
      revised parts reshape the whole. The core structural issue is governance of this loop so that
      interpretation remains revisable (Χ), scene-bound, and non-authority-laundering.

      frame_anchor: "□(interpretive_task): what counts as 'the text', 'the context', and 'understanding' here"
      protected_constraints:
        - "Interpretation remains revisable and scene-bound (Χ + reversibility)."
        - "No person-level verdicts or ontological claims are produced from interpretive readings."

      reversibility_window: >
        High during exploration and early passes; narrows when Σ produces integrated narratives
        and Ψ binds them into stable commitments (e.g., publication, teaching, institutional adoption),
        unless explicit revision pathways are preserved.

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      A salient distinction becomes decision-relevant: part vs whole, literal vs contextual,
      intended vs received meaning, signal vs noise, stable sense vs revision.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Pressure toward closure: to settle meaning, resolve ambiguity, justify action, or stabilize
      identity/authority through a definitive interpretation.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "Context needed for decisive reading is missing or contested (Λ-as-absence)."
      - "Ambiguity persists across passes; no unique mapping from parts to whole (Λ-as-underdetermination)."
      - "Counter-readings do not appear in the discourse space (Λ-as-silenced alternative)."

      - "Δ"
    reduced_signature: "Θ ∘ Φ ∘ Σ within □ (iterative recontextualization toward integrated understanding)"
    operator_notes:
      difference_delta: >
        Δ differentiates parts/whole, cues/claims, literal/contextual layers, and competing readings.
        Without Δ, nothing becomes interpretable as a contrast.
      impulse_nabla: >
        ∇ drives interpretive closure: the urge to “make sense,” to settle ambiguity, and to align
        reading with action or identity.
      frame_box: >
        □ sets what counts as the object, admissible context, and evaluation criteria for “understanding.”
        Hermeneutic circularity becomes productive only when □ is explicit and revisable.
      lambda_non_event: >
        Λ is constitutive: missing context, silence, ambiguity, and underdetermination are structured
        absences that shape the loop. Forced closure often manifests as Λ-erasure.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Α stabilizes interpretive habits (schools, default readings, methodological routines). It can
        support reliability, but can also harden into path-dependent overcoding.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Ω appears as asymmetry between interpreter and object (access, expertise), between traditions
        and outsiders, and between authoritative and marginal frames. Ω can amplify closure pressure.
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ is the iteration of reading passes: each pass updates whole/parts relations and the standing
        of evidence. Θ also includes longer-term sedimentation of tradition.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ updates meaning by embedding elements into new frames (historical context, genre, pragmatic
        setting, intertext). Φ is the mechanism of interpretive development, but also the corridor for
        frame smuggling if undeclared.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ suspends immediate closure and authority: it keeps readings scene-bound, maintains space for
        counter-readings, and prevents interpretive outputs from becoming verdicts.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ consolidates a reading into a coherent whole (a stable interpretation) that can guide action,
        teaching, or communication—while remaining revisable in principle.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ binds integrated interpretations into durable commitments (identity of a method, doctrine,
        canon, institutional line). Ψ is necessary for stability but can convert readings into dogma
        if Χ and reversibility are not preserved.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Hermeneutic circularity is not “Θ alone.” It is Θ operating under □ with Λ as constitutive absence,
      driven by ∇, stabilized by Α, and regulated by Χ. Interpretive maturity requires Φ and Σ, and
      interpretive dogmatism arises when Ψ binds Σ without maintaining Χ and reversibility.

        title: "Part–whole iteration"
        formula: "Θ^k( read(parts | whole) ) within □"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Each reading pass updates the relationship between parts and whole; understanding is not a
          single extraction but a trajectory of revisions under explicit scope.
      - signature_id: "HC_RECONTEXTUALIZATION_STEP"
        title: "Φ updates the interpretive frame"
        formula: "Φ(□_t → □_(t+1)) under Θ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Contextualization is a move (Φ): it changes what is relevant, what counts as evidence, and
          which constraints apply; it must be declared to stay critique-ready.
      - signature_id: "HC_INTEGRATION_AND_BINDING"
        title: "Σ integrates; Ψ binds"
        formula: "Σ(reading) ⇒ Ψ(commitment) (valid only with Χ + reversibility)"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          A coherent reading can be integrated and even bound into stable practice, but only if the
          validity gate remains active: no verdict fusion, no irreversible claims.
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "HC_DRIFT_FORCED_CLOSURE"
        label: "∇-driven forced closure (Λ erasure)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          The impulse to settle meaning can erase ambiguity and alternative readings, presenting a
          provisional integration as necessity.
      - drift_id: "HC_DRIFT_FRAME_SMUGGLING"
        label: "Undeclared Φ (frame smuggling)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Context can be expanded selectively to fit a preferred conclusion while remaining rhetorically
          invisible, reducing critique capacity.
      - drift_id: "HC_DRIFT_AUTHORITY_LAUNDERING"
        label: "Ψ-bound reading treated as final truth"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Once a reading is bound into institutional identity, it can be treated as unquestionable,
          converting interpretation into authority.
      - drift_id: "HC_DRIFT_INFINITE_CYCLE"
        label: "Θ without Σ (endless revision without integration)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Re-reading can continue without consolidation, producing interpretive volatility and avoidance
          of commitment or action.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      This case makes the hermeneutic circle legible as an operator-governed loop: Θ iteration under □,
      with Λ as constitutive absence, Φ as declared context update, Χ as reflective restraint, and Σ/Ψ
      as stabilization stages that must remain reversible.

  drift_classification:
    drift_present: false
    drift_label: ""
    minimal_drift_signature: ""
    observable_markers:
      - "Λ is rhetorically erased (ambiguity presented as resolved necessity)"
      - "Φ moves are undeclared (context expansion appears as obviousness)"
      - "Ψ-bound interpretations treated as unquestionable doctrine (Χ collapse)"
      - "Counter-readings systematically absent or delegitimated (Λ-as-silencing)"
      - "Θ loops continue without Σ consolidation (permanent deferral / volatility)"

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Expertise and institutional standing produce Ω gradients: who gets to define □, whose Φ moves
      count as legitimate, and whose counter-readings are heard. High Ω increases risk that Σ/Ψ become
      authority rather than integration.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Θ iteration costs time and attention; deeper iteration can increase nuance but can also delay
      integration. After Σ/Ψ (publication, canonization), revision costs rise and lock-in pressure grows.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Ambiguities, silences, and missing context accumulate as Λ-residue. Mature practice keeps Λ visible;
      drift converts Λ into hidden assumptions or coerced closure.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Iterate readings to reduce error and refine understanding under uncertainty."
      - "Rely on disciplinary templates (Α) to keep interpretation tractable."
      - "Bind an integrated reading (Σ→Ψ) to stabilize shared coordination (teaching, standards)."
      - "Expand context (Φ) to make parts intelligible, especially when literal reading fails."
      - "Pause and bracket closure (Χ) when stakes or Ω asymmetry are high."
    non_normative_note: >
      These behaviors are structurally intelligible under constraints; the case does not prescribe which
      reading is “correct,” only how interpretive structures stabilize or drift.

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Interpretations can be weaponized as verdicts about persons or groups, especially when institutional
      Ω is high and Ψ binds a reading into identity. This violates the PMS entry condition.
    structural_indicator: >
      Χ collapses (no reflective distance), Σ becomes final verdict posture, and Ψ is used to enforce
      compliance (“the meaning is settled; dissent is illegitimate”), with Λ alternatives silenced.
    validity_reminder: >
      Any use that turns interpretation into shaming, ranking, humiliation, irreversible labeling, or
      enforcement-by-authority is formally invalid as a PMS application.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No psychological account of understanding as inner experience"
      - "No guarantee of a uniquely correct interpretation"
      - "No method prescription or hermeneutic algorithm"
      - "No authority to enforce interpretations as verdicts"
    claimed:
      - "A structural account of interpretation as Θ iteration between parts and whole under explicit □"
      - "Visibility of Λ (ambiguity/absence) as constitutive, not noise"
      - "Φ as declared recontextualization and Χ as restraint enabling revisability"
      - "Σ/Ψ as stabilization stages that must remain reversible under the PMS entry condition"
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not treat PMS mapping of the hermeneutic circle as proof that a given interpretation is correct,
      nor as license to enforce a reading against persons or groups. Keep outputs scene-bound and revisable.

  structural_closure: >
    The hermeneutic circle is structurally a Θ-iterated adjustment between parts and whole within an explicit □,
    driven by ∇ closure pressure and shaped by Λ absences. Interpretive development proceeds via Φ (declared
    recontextualization) and may consolidate in Σ (integrated understanding). Stability arises when Ψ binds Σ
    into durable commitments, but validity requires Χ and reversibility to remain active; otherwise Ψ converts
    interpretation into authority and Λ alternatives are erased.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Understanding is not a one-shot extraction of meaning. It is an iterative loop: what you think the whole
    means shapes how you read the parts, and what you find in the parts reshapes your sense of the whole.
    This becomes robust when the context you use is explicit and revisable, when ambiguities stay visible,
    and when you keep enough distance to revise your reading instead of turning it into a final verdict.
