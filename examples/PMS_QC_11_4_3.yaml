          PMS core can represent difference/outcome distinction (Δ), framing (□), non-events (Λ),
          temporality (Θ), integration/commit boundaries (Σ), and self-binding (Ψ). However, PMS core
          alone does not provide QC-native audit handles for measurement as a first-class workflow
          motif (QMEASURE(basis, register)), measurement-frame requirements (□_meas), or logging
          conventions that keep discarded outcomes / post-selection / unrealised branches visible
          as Λ rather than rhetorically erased. The QC layer supplies macro language, measurement-
          specific frame constraints, and audit expectations that keep Δ/Λ explicit in governance traces.

    context: >
      A quantum workflow (circuit, hybrid DAG, or macro program) performs one or more measurement
      operations. Outcomes are used to select downstream actions, report results, or justify claims.
      The analysis targets auditability of measurement semantics as Δ-resolution plus Λ non-events
      (unrealised branches, discarded outcomes, post-selection) under explicit □ measurement frames,
      tracked across Σ commit points and bounded by Ψ governance—rather than gate-level details or
      physical noise models.

      frame_anchor: >
        Measurement as an operator-level audit object—valid only if basis and register scope are
        explicit (□_meas discipline), Δ outcomes and Λ non-events are logged as such, and post-selection/

    operator_notes:

        Measurement audit requires explicit scope: basis, register, and what counts as a valid readout (□_meas).
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Measurement enforces directionality (quantum alternatives → classical control). Organisational control
        of logging/post-processing adds further Ω gradients.
      theta_temporality: >
        Repetition (shots/runs) magnifies Ω and increases incentives for selective retention unless governed.
      lambda_residue: >
        Unrealised branches, discarded outcomes, rejected shots/runs: Λ must remain visible; otherwise Λ becomes
        an invisibility channel and auditability collapses.

        Reporting defaults can stabilise outcome-only narratives (Α), normalising discard/compression patterns.
      recontext_phi: >
        Basis changes and post-processing reinterpretation are Φ moves; valid only if explicit and traceable.
        Φ-after-Σ rewrite is drift unless governed by Ψ with trace continuity.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ freezes measurement semantics at checkpoints (submission/execution/reporting), preventing retroactive rewrite.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ binds governance: mandatory logging, admissible discard policies, version pins, and revision pathways.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ is required so audit remains structural and revisable (not verdict/certificate).
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signatures are shorthand. Canonical PMS dependencies remain authoritative (e.g., Λ depends on □;
      Θ presupposes Ω/Α; Σ presupposes Χ/Φ; Ψ presupposes Σ/Θ/Χ). In audit terms: (Λ ∘ Δ) must be read together
      with its □_meas frame, Θ repetition, Σ commits, and Ψ bindings; otherwise measurement semantics are structurally
      under-specified.

    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      QC supplies explicit measurement macros, measurement-frame constraints, and audit/log expectations that keep Δ outcomes
      and Λ non-events jointly visible. This makes discarded outcomes and post-selection first-class audit objects rather than
      hidden reporting choices.

  cost_and_exposure:

      Measurement privileges the classical readout/control path and whoever controls logging/post-processing. Downstream

    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      More shots/runs increase resource usage and reporting pressure; after Σ, changing discard rules implies re-audit.
      Without Ψ revision rules, lock-in becomes implicit and unauditable.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Unlogged discards/unrealised branches accumulate as Λ-residue: ambiguity about representativeness, unverifiable claims,

      - "Θ repetition magnifies measurement asymmetry and incentivises selective retention unless governed by Ψ."
      - "Σ commits freeze measurement semantics; post-Σ semantic rewrite is invalid unless Ψ-governed with trace continuity."
      - "Optional MIP is appropriate when traces are used as governance artefacts (misuse corridor control)."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not convert measurement audit traces into proof, certification, or enforcement logic. Do not erase Λ by outcome-only
      reporting. Keep outputs structural, revisable, and dignity-constrained.

  structural_closure: >
    Measurement remains structurally auditable only when the measurement frame (□_meas) is explicit, outcomes (Δ) and non-events (Λ)
    remain jointly visible, repetition (Θ) and its incentives are acknowledged, and commit points (Σ) freeze semantics such that Φ cannot
    silently rewrite what was measured. Drift is prepared when Λ is erased through reporting defaults, post-selection becomes invisible,
    and Ψ governance is inflated into guarantee language while Χ collapses into certificate posture.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Measurement doesn’t just produce a result—it also creates “non-results”: branches and outcomes that didn’t happen or were thrown away.
    This case is about keeping both visible. A good audit trail clearly states how measurement was done (basis and register), records how many
    runs were discarded and why, and marks when the workflow is committed so the meaning of “what was measured” can’t be rewritten later.
    Passing these checks isn’t proof the algorithm works—it just makes the workflow inspectable and prevents selective reporting from hiding
    what really happened.
