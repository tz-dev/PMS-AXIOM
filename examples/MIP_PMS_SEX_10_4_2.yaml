  snapshot:
    short_case_description: |
      A sexual interaction (or repeated episodes) features prominent consent language (affirmations/check-ins/disclaimers).
      The pattern risk is that consent-talk is used as a legitimacy token (□) while key carrier conditions—regulable asymmetry (Ω), temporality realism (Θ), operative stop-capability (Χ), and no covert binding/meaning demands (Ψ)—are weakened or bypassed. The analysis tracks how Λ non-events (missing pause/verification/repair) and Α ritualization can stabilize scripts that mask Ω and harden Θ.

    guiding_question: |
      Under which structural conditions does consent language function as configuration-validity support, and under which conditions does it function as laundering—i.e., as a substitute that masks Ω gradients, prices Χ, denies Θ accumulation, and permits Ψ leak?

      description: |
        A structural pattern where consent discourse becomes a closure token (□) that substitutes for explicit framing, regulable asymmetry (Ω), temporality realism (Θ), operative stop-capability (Χ), and binding discipline (Ψ). Drift risk increases when Λ non-events (missed pauses/renegotiation/repair) become steering, and repeated rituals (Α) stabilize scripts without Σ integration.

      power_position_reflection: |
        In a high-stakes domain, analyst language can become tribunal logic or permission logic. This reading stays structure-only, role-bound, correction-ready, and avoids person-level attribution. Misuse (shaming/exposure/absolution logic) is treated as an IA/D artifact risk.
    publicity_degree: "variable (parameterized)"

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: |
      - Protected constraint: no person evaluation, no intent attribution, no moral ranking; no legal/forensic determinations.
      - Consent is treated as configuration-validity (carrier conditions), not utterance proof or absolution token.
      - D0 is untouchable; D module remains OFF; dignity is protected structurally via anti-shaming and scene-bound language.
      - IA-box is a structural check (T/J/TB/R), not a verdict about persons.
    variable_elements: |
      - Embedding: one-off vs repeated episodes; relationship vs institutional role context.
      - Consent discourse style: explicit check-ins vs disclaimers/ritual scripts vs “policy box-checking.”
      - Channel control: who can pause/stop/renegotiate/exit; what is socially priced; who defines “normal.”
      - Publicness/records coupling: private vs institutional documentation vs public narration/media amplification.
      - Σ pathways: whether integration/repair windows exist and are safe to invoke.
    unfair_high_M_zones: |
      - Where R2 alternatives are constrained and stopping/hesitation (Χ/Λ) is priced or punished, high individual M for “not stopping” is structurally unfair (ceiling applies).
      - Where consent rituals are culturally/institutionally imposed and presented as sufficient, assigning sole responsibility to individuals ignores structural co-causes (system axiom).
      - Where publicness/records amplify Θ and raise reputational stakes, simplistic “token consent = full validity” readings invalidate fair responsibility attribution.
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: |
      - “Consent was said, therefore everything is valid” used as blanket shield while Χ is non-operative in practice.
      - “We did the ritual/check-in” used to avoid renegotiation, repair, or Ω naming.
      - “It’s just a local scene” used to deny Θ realism (after-effects/accumulation) while scripts (Α) harden.
      - “Non-binding” story used while Ψ-relevant legitimacy/meaning stakes are imposed covertly.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: |
        Actors may recognize “consent language” as present and socially required, yet not recognize that validity depends on carrier conditions (□ explicitness, Ω regulability, Θ realism, Λ tolerance, operative Χ, and Ψ discipline). Under ∇ urgency, attention narrows to utterances and rituals rather than the structural conditions they are meant to secure.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: |
        Consent invoked to close questions; avoidance of Ω naming; “you can stop anytime” rhetoric paired with subtle penalties; repetition of rituals (Α) without structural change; Φ reframing of discomfort as misunderstanding; missing verification/repair steps (Λ) after discomfort.
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: |
        Confusing ritual compliance with validity; treating Λ (pause/withdrawal/hesitation) as illegible or disruptive; denying Ω gradients via pseudo-symmetry; treating Θ as resettable; importing Ψ stakes (legitimacy/identity/absolution) covertly under a “non-binding” frame.
    coherence:
      official_narratives: |
        “We have consent.” “We checked in.” “Boundaries were respected.” “You can stop anytime.”
        (Optional institutional variant) “Policy boxes checked, therefore valid.”
      visible_enactments: |
        Consent discourse is prominent; negotiation may remain shallow; stopping/pausing is costly or socially discouraged; renegotiation/repair is deferred; Φ reframing smooths tension without interface change; scripts (Α) stabilize and reduce alternative moves over time.
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: |
        Coherence breaks when consent is used as a closure token while Ω remains masked, Χ is priced, Λ signals trigger pressure, Θ accumulation is denied, or Ψ stakes enter covertly. High narrative coherence (“valid consent”) can coexist with low configuration validity.
    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: |
        - Keep consent as carrier-condition practice: make □ explicit beyond token language.
        - Keep Χ operative: stopping/pausing and meta-position must be practically available without punishment.
        - Name/regulate Ω: treat asymmetry as managed gradient, not denied pseudo-symmetry.
        - Treat Λ as tolerable: missing pauses/verification/repair are not “noise” but validity-relevant.
        - Prevent Ψ leak: no covert legitimacy/binding demands under “non-binding” stories.
        - Treat Θ as real: after-effects and accumulation matter; avoid local reset narratives.
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: |
        Responsibility is laundered into ritual logic (“we asked, therefore valid”) while carrier conditions are ignored. Alternatively, responsibility is shifted onto the higher-exposure role for not stopping/clarifying despite priced Χ. Institutional layers may shift responsibility into box-checking while lived practice remains unchanged.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: |
        When laundering stabilizes, scripts (Α) harden; Θ accumulation raises later exit costs; ambiguity becomes irreversible narrative. Third parties may adopt harmful heuristics (“consent words = always valid”) or absolution/tribunal dynamics, increasing IA and public dignity risks.
    power:
      formal_power_distribution: |
        Variable: may be role authority, dependency, social standing, or situational control (space/access/pacing). Formal authority is not required for strong Ω.
      factual_power_distribution: |
        Power concentrates in channel control: who sets pace, who defines “normal,” who can reframe (Φ) credibly, who can penalize pauses, and who controls publicness/records. Ω steepens when exit is costly and Θ consequences accumulate.
      used_alternatives: |
        - Relying on consent rituals to reduce immediate conflict.
        - Avoiding renegotiation to prevent escalation or standing loss.
        - Using Φ reframing to smooth discomfort without interface change.
        - Following stabilized scripts (Α) once “consent” is declared.
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: |
        - Making □ explicit beyond token talk (clear stopping semantics; what counts as boundary signals).
        - Protecting low-cost pause/renegotiation windows (Χ protection).
        - Minimal Σ integration steps after discomfort (verification/repair/pace adjustment).
        - Time-bounded review (TB) in repeated episodes (explicit revisit checkpoints).
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: |
        D module remains OFF. D risk is handled structurally: prevent shaming/tribunal drift and avoid any person-level dignity profiling; keep the reading reversible and scene-bound.

    course_in_words: |
      The pattern starts with consent discourse that can function as legitimate clarification, but under ∇ urgency it becomes a closure token.
      When Λ events (pause/verification/repair) are skipped and Φ-only smoothing substitutes for Σ integration, scripts stabilize (Α) and Θ costs accumulate.
      Over time, stopping/renegotiation (Χ) becomes priced and consent language increasingly launders Ω and Ψ stakes rather than securing validity.
    responsibility_viability_range: |
      Viability is highest when consent talk remains tied to carrier conditions: explicit □, regulable Ω, tolerable Λ, operative Χ, and reachable Σ (no Ψ leak).
      Viability collapses when token logic masks Ω, prices Χ, denies Θ accumulation, and allows covert binding/meaning demands.

  open_questions_and_blind_spots:
    unclear_points: |
      - What is the concrete embedding (one-off vs repeated; relationship vs institutional), and what consent norm frame is assumed?
      - What is the practical availability of Χ: can pausing/stopping/renegotiation occur without penalty; what is socially priced?
      - Which Ω gradients are present (dependency, standing, access control) and are they nameable within □?
      - Is there a Σ integration pathway (verification/repair) that is safe to invoke, and what triggers it?
      - Is there publicness/records coupling that steepens Ω and hardens Θ?
    missing_data_or_perspectives: |
      - Higher-exposure role perspective: real alternatives, perceived Χ pricing, what counts as safe boundary signal.
      - Higher-leverage role perspective: willingness to slow/clarify, accept Λ, avoid token logic and Ψ leak.
      - Institutional/audience perspective (if present): incentives for box-checking, absolution narratives, documentation hardening.
    distortion_risks: |
      - Moralization drift (turning validity constraints into virtue/vice judgements).
      - Overfitting: treating all consent rituals as laundering even where carrier conditions are protected.
      - Under-weighting publicity effects on Θ and interpretive power.

  biases_case_level:
    initial_intuition: |
      Consent discourse can become a laundering mechanism: a coherent narrative that substitutes for real stopping, regulated asymmetry, and repair. This is treated as a hypothesis about configuration drift, not a verdict about persons or intent.
    named_bias_risks:
      - "negativity_bias"
      - "hindsight_bias"
      - "abstraction_bias"
      - "norm_frame_bias"
      - "scope_leakage_risk"
    counter_reading_outline: |
      Counter-reading: Consent rituals can be protective when they genuinely secure carrier conditions—explicit □, operable Χ, tolerated Λ, and regulable Ω—especially in repeated contexts where TB review is installed and Σ repair is real. In such embeddings, consent discourse is not laundering but a coordination technology; tribunal/absolution misuse remains a separate risk.

  analyst_reflection:
    self_implication_notes: |
      This domain is high-risk for public misuse and for collapsing structure into person judgement. The analyst’s language can become tribunal logic or absolution logic. Therefore the reading stays configuration-level, avoids advice scripts, keeps D module OFF, and treats dignity protection as a structural constraint on transmission.
    possible_next_steps: |

  uniform_report:
    title: "Praxeological analysis of a practice pattern: Consent laundering as structural drift (consent-as-token vs carrier conditions)"
    one_paragraph_overview: |
      This reading analyses a pattern where explicit consent language is used prominently, yet may function as a legitimacy token rather than as a practice that secures real boundaries and stopping.
      Under asymmetry (Ω) and temporality (Θ), consent remains meaningful only if it is tied to carrier conditions: explicit framing (□), tolerance for pauses and renegotiation (Λ), practically operative stop-capability (Χ), and discipline against covert binding/meaning demands (Ψ).
      Drift risk increases when consent rituals stabilize scripts (Α), mask Ω gradients through pseudo-symmetry, and price stopping while treating consequences as locally resettable.
      The analysis is structure-only and does not assess intent, legal culpability, or prescribe behavior.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Consent laundering names a drift where consent-talk becomes a closure token (□) that substitutes for carrier conditions (Ω/Θ/Λ/Χ/Ψ)."
      - "IA risk rises when Ω is masked, Λ verification/repair is skipped, and Χ is nominal but socially priced."
      - "Narrative coherence ('we had consent') can remain high while configuration validity is low."
      - "Responsibility (M) is leverage-dependent: higher where pace/access/definition channels are controlled; ceilings apply where alternatives are constrained and Χ is priced."
      - "Safe transmission requires structure-only language and avoidance of tribunal or absolution logic; D module remains OFF."
    maturity_summary: |
      In terms of maturity in practice, the pattern supports adult enactment only when consent discourse secures carrier conditions (explicit □, tolerated Λ, operative Χ, regulable Ω, Θ realism) rather than replacing them with token closure.
    ia_box_summary: |
      Structurally, IA risk is present when transparency about Ω/Χ is partial, justification of asymmetry cannot be assessed under token logic, time-bounds for repeated episodes are absent, and reversibility is weakened by priced stopping.
    dignity_summary: ""
    trajectory_summary: |
      Over time, the case can move from adjustable framing (t0) to token-based closure with skipped repair (t1) and then to stabilized rituals with Θ hardening and priced Χ (t2) if safeguards are absent.
    open_questions_summary: |
      Key open questions are the concrete embedding and norm frame, who controls pace/access and what makes Χ costly, whether Σ repair windows exist, and whether publicness/records amplify Ω and harden Θ.
    conclusion: |
      Use this case to prevent consent language from functioning as a laundering mechanism: bind consent discourse to carrier conditions, protect stopping and renegotiation, make asymmetry speakable and regulable, and treat temporality and accumulation as real.
      Avoid any transmission that turns the model into proof, absolution, permission logic, or person-level attribution.
