        why_this_addon: >
          The “other minds” problem is structurally a future-stance and trust calibration problem under Λ:
          direct access is absent, signals can fail, and closure pressure pushes toward certainty or denial.
          The ANTICIPATION overlay adds disciplined handling of non-occurrence (Λ), temporality (Θ),
          asymmetry exposure (Ω), and post-confirmation restraint—preventing “probability → authority”
          and “uncertainty → coercion” drift that PMS-core alone would not explicitly regulate.

    context: >
      An agent must coordinate with other agents (people, institutions, or systems) without direct access
      to their inner experience, sincerity, or future reliability. The classical “other minds” uncertainty
      appears as a practical trust problem: how to treat others as minded, accountable, and interpretable
      under persistent underaccess. The case is treated structurally (frames, non-events, trajectories,
      exposure), not as a metaphysical proof problem.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        The question is constrained to praxis coordination: when and how “mindedness attribution”
        functions as a stabilizing stance for interaction (communication, responsibility, cooperation).
        No claim is made about consciousness as an ontological fact. The frame is “interactional warrant”
        rather than “metaphysical certainty.”
      protected_constraints:
        - "No metaphysical proof demand (no consciousness-ontology claims)"
        - "No mind-reading or intent attribution as output"
        - "Trust is treated as a scene-bound stance under Λ, not as certainty"
        - "Reversibility: attributions remain revisable and frame-relative"
        - "Dignity-in-practice (D): no dehumanization, humiliation, or coercive leverage under Ω"
      out_of_frame:
        - "Solving consciousness / qualia / metaphysical mind-body questions"
        - "Global person labels ('they have no mind', 'they are evil', 'they are irrational')"
        - "Clinical, diagnostic, or forensic inference from interaction fragments"
        - "Authority claims derived from 'knowing what they really think/feel'"
    temporality:
      time_scale: "repeated interaction over weeks to years (Θ)"
      iteration_rhythm: "signal-response loops; repair cycles; expectation updates"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "repeated conversational coordination stabilizing patterns (Α)"
        - "institutional roles and repeated commitments (□/Ω-supported)"
        - "history of fulfilled / unfulfilled expectations carried as Λ-residue (Θ ∘ Λ)"
      reversibility_window: >
        Trust attributions must remain revisable as frames shift (Φ) and as new non-events (Λ) accumulate.
        Revision is constrained only where legitimate commitments have been explicitly bound (Ψ) under valid gates
        and where changing stance would itself produce disproportionate harm under Ω/Θ.
    roles:
      - role_label: "Observer / Trusting agent"
        function: "Must decide how to treat the other as interpretable, accountable, and responsive"
        exposure_profile: "Exposure to deception risk, coordination failure, and reputational cost"
        notes: "Modelled as a carrier of stance and self-binding (Χ/Σ/Ψ), not as a psychological subject."
      - role_label: "Other / Target of attribution"
        function: "Provides observable signals; may cooperate, defect, or remain opaque"
        exposure_profile: "Exposure to being misread, reduced to an object, or coerced via attribution"
        notes: "Not analyzed as a mind; analyzed as a role-position within □/Ω under Λ."
      - role_label: "Third parties / Institutions (optional)"
        function: "Stabilize attributions (records, norms) and amplify consequences"
        exposure_profile: "Can harden attributions into durable labels (Ω gradients)"
        notes: "Key risk channel for irreversibility laundering under Θ."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Structural difference between first-person access and third-person access:
      the observer has privileged access to self-reporting but only indirect access to others via signals.
      This difference generates a standing opacity boundary in interaction.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Closure demand for certainty: pressure to settle whether the other “really has a mind,”
      “really means it,” or “will reliably act as expected,” so that coordination feels safe and justified.
      The impulse intensifies under vulnerability and stakes (Ω) and under closing windows (Θ).
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "No direct access to inner experience is available (the access gap is structurally persistent)."
      - "Expected confirmation of sincerity/reliability does not arrive or arrives ambiguously (silence, mismatch, delay)."
      - "Signals that would settle interpretation remain missing or can be plausibly faked (Λ as underaccess)."

    operator_chain: ["Ψ", "Σ", "Χ", "Φ", "Θ", "Ω", "Α", "Λ", "□", "∇", "Δ"]
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        The interactional frame (□) defines what “mindedness attribution” is for:
        coordination, accountability, interpretability, repair. Frame creep converts stance into ontology.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Trust decisions are asymmetric: misattribution can expose one side to exploitation or to dehumanization.
        Institutions can magnify Ω by turning provisional stance into durable classification.
      theta_temporality: >
        Trust calibration is a Θ-trajectory: it evolves through repeated non-events (Λ), confirmations,
        repairs, and revisions across time. Closing windows can intensify ∇ pressure for premature certainty.
      lambda_residue: >
        The access gap and signal ambiguity are irreducible residues: Λ cannot be eliminated without
        smuggling metaphysical closure or illegitimate authority claims.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Repeated interaction stabilizes expectations: observable reliability/repair loops form Α patterns
        that can support workable trust without settling ontology.
      recontext_phi: >
        New information or changing contexts embed prior interactions into new frames (Φ),
        altering what counts as evidence, betrayal, or repair.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ integrates multiple signals (behavioral consistency, repair moves, institutional cues)
        into a coherent stance, while explicitly keeping Λ open (integration without totalization).
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ binds the observer to a stable interaction policy (e.g., how to extend trust, how to revise,
        what counts as repair) rather than binding the other through coercive obligation claims.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ is the stop-capability: it prevents “I know their mind” closure, blocks paranoia totalization,
        and prevents using opacity as warrant for dominance under Ω.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Overlay case (ANTICIPATION) with PMS_1.1 dependencies preserved.
      Reduced signatures (e.g., ANT_min) are shorthand only and do not bypass prerequisites.
      Canonical dependency hygiene: □ depends on (Δ,∇); Λ on □; Α on (Δ,∇,□,Λ); Ω on Α;
      Θ on (Ω,Α); Φ on (Θ,Ω,□); Χ on (Φ,Θ,□); Σ on (Χ,Φ); Ψ on (Σ,Θ,Χ).
      Operator chain is recorded in canonical top-down notation (Ψ…Δ) for audit alignment.

        formula: "Δ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Θ ∘ Χ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Trust is treated as a present stance: a bounded attribution (Δ in □) remains structurally open (Λ)
          over time (Θ) with maintained restraint (Χ). This forbids treating trust as settled certainty or
          as action-authorizing entitlement.
      - signature_id: "ANT_viable_full"
        title: "Viable anticipatory configuration (trust calibration)"
        formula: "Δ ∘ ∇ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α ∘ Ω ∘ Θ ∘ Φ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ ∘ Ψ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Mature trust calibration disciplines closure impulse (∇), uses repeated patterns (Α) and revision (Φ),
          audits exposure gradients (Ω) across time (Θ), preserves stop-capability (Χ), integrates without
          totalization (Σ), and binds the observer to a revisable stance (Ψ).
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "certainty_replaces_Λ"
        label: "Λ replaced by certainty"
        why_plausible_here: >
          The classical demand for “proof of other minds” pushes toward eliminating opacity by treating
          plausible interpretation as settled fact, collapsing stance into ontology.
      - drift_id: "Χ_suspended"
        label: "Χ suspended ('I know better')"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Under stress, agents may overinterpret signals as decisive and lose reflective distance,
          enabling escalation, paranoia, or dominance claims.
      - drift_id: "Ω_instrumentalized"
        label: "Ω instrumentalized"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Opacity can be weaponized: “since you can’t prove it,” one side uses power to force compliance,
          surveillance, or punishment—turning uncertainty into leverage.
      - drift_id: "Ψ_externalized"
        label: "Ψ externalized ('others must...')"
        why_plausible_here: >
          The observer may convert their anticipatory stance into obligations imposed on the other
          (“you must prove your sincerity / mindedness”), shifting binding outward and inviting coercion.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      ANTICIPATION makes explicit that the “other minds” gap is a standing Λ-structure under Θ,
      not an eliminable defect. It adds drift controls preventing (i) prophecy-like certainty,
      (ii) action compulsion under probability rhetoric, and (iii) coercive exploitation of Ω
      by laundering uncertainty into authority.

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Miscalibrated trust can expose the observer to exploitation or expose the other to dehumanization.
      Third-party institutions can amplify Ω by turning provisional attributions into enforceable labels.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Long-run interaction histories create path dependence: early attributions and institutional records
      can lock in future treatment. Repair opportunities can close; delayed feedback increases uncertainty load.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      The residue is structural and persistent: inner access is unavailable, and signals are underdetermined.
      Attempts to eliminate Λ typically reappear as covert metaphysics, proxy measures, or coercive tests.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Declare the interactional frame (□) before making attribution claims; keep scope scene-bound."
      - "Treat opacity as Λ to be carried, not as a defect to be erased by certainty rhetoric."
      - "Use Α over Θ: rely on repeated repair/reliability patterns rather than single decisive interpretations."
      - "Maintain Χ under stress: prevent paranoia totalization and prevent 'I know your mind' assertions."
      - "Integrate (Σ) signals without totalization; preserve explicit uncertainty where warranted."
      - "Bind the stance inward (Ψ): commit to revisable trust policies rather than externalizing demands onto others."
      - "Audit Ω: where exposure is unequal, increase restraint (D) and avoid turning uncertainty into leverage."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      The other-minds gap can be used to justify dehumanization (“they don’t count as minded”),
      surveillance/compulsion (“prove it”), or humiliation (“your inner life is irrelevant”),
      especially when Ω gradients are strong.
    structural_indicator: >
      Λ is treated as warrant for dominance: uncertainty is converted into authority claims,
      Χ collapses, and institutional frames harden provisional stance into coercive classification.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No metaphysical solution to consciousness or qualia is provided."
      - "No proof or disproof of other minds is attempted."
      - "No mind-reading, intent attribution, or psychological inference is licensed."
      - "No prescription of interventions, surveillance, or enforcement is implied."
    claimed:
      - "The other-minds problem is reframed as a structural trust calibration problem under Λ within □ over Θ."
      - "A taxonomy of interactional trust stances and their drift risks can be produced (calibration output)."
      - "Boundary policies can prevent 'uncertainty → authority' and 'probability → compulsion' conversions."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use this case to deny personhood, justify coercive control, or harden interpretive stance into
      irreversible labels. The model disciplines how uncertainty is carried; it does not authorize domination.

  structural_closure: >
    PMS + ANTICIPATION yields a bounded closure: “other minds” is not a defect to be eliminated but a
    standing Λ-structure in interaction. Under explicit frames (□), trust is a revisable stance carried over Θ,
    stabilized by Α-patterns and integrated by Σ without collapsing Λ. Χ prevents prophecy-like certainty and
    blocks coercive drift under Ω. Output type: calibration report (Λ/Θ/Ω/Χ accounting) plus boundary policy
    forbidding conversion of uncertainty into authority.

  plain_language_summary: >
    We can’t directly access what others experience or intend, so some uncertainty will always remain.
    Instead of trying to “prove” other minds, this case treats trust as a practical stance: we decide how to
    interact based on patterns over time, while keeping uncertainty explicit. The goal is to avoid turning
    uncertainty into either paranoia or coercive control, and to keep trust revisable without dehumanizing anyone.
