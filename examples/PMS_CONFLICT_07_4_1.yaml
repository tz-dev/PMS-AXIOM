        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can represent differences, impulses, frames, non-events, patterns,
          asymmetry, temporality, recontextualization, distance, integration, and
          self-binding. The CONFLICT overlay is required to formalize when incompatibility
          becomes stabilized under persistent binding, Θ-hardening, Ω-gradients, and
          priced/asymmetric Χ—i.e., when Σ can remain locally coherent while joint Σ
          becomes structurally non-viable. The overlay provides drift classes and
          terminal-positioning outputs (tragedy formalism / repair policy boundaries)
          that prevent covert conversion into “solutions,” diagnosis, or enforcement.

    context: >
      A coupled interaction persists between two role positions with ongoing stakes.
      Both sides can articulate internally coherent reasons within their own frames,
      yet attempts to produce a shared continuation repeatedly fail. Pressure rises
      to "resolve," "decide," or "assign responsibility," while costs accumulate.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: "Joint continuation demanded under sustained coupling"
      protected_constraints:
        - "No person-level labeling or global claims (reversibility constraint)."
        - "Maintain reflective distance (Χ) as stop-capability, not as domination."
        - "Do not convert structural description into enforcement or authority."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Psychological diagnosis, motive inference, personality typing."
        - "Moral ranking, blame assignment, virtue sorting."
        - "Intervention scripts or stepwise resolution methods."
        - "Governance decisions (hire/fire/sanction) without explicit mode shift."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "mid-to-long (weeks to years)"
      iteration_rhythm: "recurrent episodes with partial resets"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "Repeated contact / required coordination (coupling)"
        - "Durable records or reputational memory (Θ-hardening)"
        - "Obligation continuity (Ψ persistence)"
      reversibility_window: >
        Narrowing: early moves become path-dependent; later revision incurs increasing
        social, procedural, or reputational cost.
    roles:
      - role_label: "Position A"
        function: "Maintains a coherent local integration (Σ_A) under its frame (□_A)"
        exposure_profile: "Exposure / liability shaped by Ω gradients in the scene"
        notes: "Can be individually coherent while remaining jointly incompatible."
      - role_label: "Position B"
        function: "Maintains a coherent local integration (Σ_B) under its frame (□_B)"
        exposure_profile: "Exposure / liability shaped by Ω gradients in the scene"
        notes: "May face different priced access to distance/exit (Χ) than Position A."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      A structured difference between two coherence-spines: what counts as relevant,
      what counts as concession, what counts as obligation, and what counts as harm.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Closure pressure toward settlement: resolve the disagreement, secure a decision,
      assign responsibility, stop the uncertainty, restore a single narrative.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "Non-acknowledgment of concessions (Λ: 'that did not land')"
      - "Delayed decisions that function as leverage (Λ under Θ)"
      - "Missing repair signals after explicit requests (Λ becomes load-bearing)"

  operator_mapping:
    operator_chain: ["Ψ", "Σ", "Χ", "Φ", "Θ", "Ω", "Α", "Λ", "□", "∇", "Δ"]
    reduced_signature: "Σ Ψ Ω Θ Χ"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        Competing frames define different relevance structures; attempts to negotiate
        content slide into negotiation about frames (□_A vs □_B).
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Asymmetry organizes exposure and capacity: who can delay, withdraw, or reframe
        cheaply; whose costs and risks are amplified by coupling.
      theta_temporality: >
        Trajectories harden: earlier framings constrain later moves; option spaces shrink;
        record coupling increases the cost of revision.
      lambda_residue: >
        Absences become meaning carriers (silence, omission, delay); Λ accumulates as
        residue and can function as control channel under Θ/Ω.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Repeated cycles stabilize into an attractor (Α_conflict): predictable escalation
        points, recurring breakdown moments, habitual scripts.
      recontext_phi: >
        Recontextualization attempts shift meaning (bridge or substitution). Under exposure,
        Φ can drift into narrative enforcement rather than mutual adaptation.
      integration_sigma: >
        Local integration remains viable within each position (Σ_A, Σ_B), but joint integration
        fails: Σ_A ≠ Σ_B under the same coupling conditions.
      binding_psi: >
        Binding persists (explicit obligations, identity commitments, institutional roles).
        Persistence turns incompatibility into a durable regime rather than a transient disagreement.
      distance_chi: >
        Distance is available only at a price and possibly asymmetrically. Attempts to pause
        or step back are interpreted as betrayal or can be punished, shrinking Χ viability.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signatures are shorthand only. In PMS, Χ depends on Φ, Θ, and □; Σ depends
      on Χ and Φ; Ψ depends on Σ, Θ, and Χ. The chain above preserves canonical ordering.

    active_signatures:
      - signature_id: "CONFLICT_terminal_core"
        title: "CONFLICT terminal core (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Σ + Ψ + Ω + Θ + Χ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          The conflict is stabilized: binding persists (Ψ) while Σ cannot produce a shared
          continuation under Θ-hardening and Ω gradients; Χ is present but priced/asymmetric.
      - signature_id: "DRIFT_binding_collision"
        title: "Binding collision (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Ψ + Ω + Θ + Σ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Obligations/commitments collide such that any joint Σ would require prohibitive
          concessions or costs; integration attempts increase cost without restoring viability.
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "sigma_incompatibility_clash"
        label: "Σ-incompatibility (integration clash)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Both sides exhibit high internal coherence, yet joint consolidation remains non-viable;
          attempts to force integration trigger escalation and breakdown.
      - drift_id: "binding_collision_drift"
        label: "Binding collision (Ψ-collision)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Coupling persists while obligations exclude each other; repair attempts raise costs
          and harden trajectories rather than resolving incompatibility.
      - drift_id: "asymmetry_lock_in_drift"
        label: "Asymmetry lock-in (Χ priced asymmetrically)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          One role position can delay/withdraw/reframe cheaply; the other cannot, making
          interruptibility itself a power gradient that stabilizes conflict.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      CONFLICT makes the non-viability of joint Σ explicit and provides a disciplined
      terminal-positioning language (legibility without reintegration). It also provides
      drift typing that prevents misreading persistence as misunderstanding or as moral failure,
      and introduces application-boundary constraints (publicness/misuse gradient) to prevent
      conversion into enforcement affordances.

  drift_classification:
    drift_present: true
    drift_label: "Σ-incompatibility with binding persistence (joint Σ non-viable under Ψ/Θ/Ω with priced Χ)"
    minimal_drift_signature: "Σ (distorted/under load) + Ψ + Θ + Ω (+ Χ priced)"
    observable_markers:
      - "High-quality articulation persists without convergence."
      - "Negotiation shifts from content to premises/frames."
      - "Repair attempts increase costs or resentment without increasing shared Σ."
      - "Escalation occurs when a single narrative or settlement is demanded."
      - "Interruptions (Χ) become contested, punished, or asymmetrically accessible."

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Exposure, liability, and capacity are unevenly distributed; the party with greater
      exposure has higher costs for delay, withdrawal, or public disagreement. Ω also shapes
      who can safely request meta-positioning (Χ) without reputational penalty.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Path dependence increases: earlier commitments constrain later options. Revision becomes
      costly due to accumulated record, sunk coordination costs, or reputational coupling.
      The longer the regime persists, the more "settlement demand" intensifies.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Missing acknowledgments and delayed responses accumulate as structural residue, becoming
      interpretive leverage and increasing attribution pressure under Θ/Ω.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Maintaining local coherence while refusing forced joint integration (Σ integrity under non-viability)."
      - "Attempting Φ-bridges (reframing) while monitoring drift into substitution/enforcement."
      - "Seeking Χ (pause/withdrawal) to prevent escalation when available without dignity collapse."
      - "Reducing claim scope to scene-bound statements to preserve reversibility and prevent Φ capture."
      - "Explicitly tracking Ω gradients rather than pretending symmetry in costs or obligations."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Under rising closure pressure, structural language is at risk of being converted into
      shaming, global labels, or coercive exposure (D-collapse via Φ under Ω/Θ).
    structural_indicator: >
      Increasing use of person-level compression, moralization, or public threat; shrinking tolerance
      for Χ; escalation of audience coupling (P overlay).
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No claim that either position is irrational, immature, or malicious."
      - "No claim about inner states, motives, or traits."
      - "No promise of resolution or repair as a method."
      - "No authorization for enforcement, selection, or reputational action."
    claimed:
      - "Conflict can be structurally stabilized as incompatibility under binding, time, cost, and exposure."
      - "Local coherence can coexist with joint non-integrability (Σ_A and Σ_B can both be coherent)."
      - "Asymmetry and temporality can price distance, making interruption itself a contested resource."
      - "The overlay provides finite outputs: legibility and boundary policies, not solutions."
    misuse_warning: >
      High misuse risk if translated into person-labels, selection/sorting, public prosecution,
      or governance claims. If publicness is high or records are durable, apply application-boundary
      declarations (mode/publicness/misuse gradient) or refuse transfer.

  structural_closure: >
    Conflict-as-incompatibility is the stabilized regime where a shared Σ cannot be produced
    under persistent Ψ with Θ-hardening and Ω gradients, while Χ becomes priced/asymmetric and Φ
    drifts toward substitution. The CONFLICT lens ends at legibility: it specifies the terminal
    non-integrability boundary and prevents covert moralization or solution laundering.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Sometimes a conflict is not a misunderstanding and not a lack of effort. Each side can have
    a coherent view that makes sense within its own situation, yet the two views cannot be turned
    into one shared path without unacceptable costs. Over time, commitments and consequences pile up,
    and even taking a pause can become expensive or unevenly available. This case describes that
    situation structurally and sets boundaries so the description is not turned into blame,
    diagnosis, or a forced “solution.”
