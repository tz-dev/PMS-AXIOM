        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can describe planning-relevant structure (□, Λ, Α, Ω, Θ),
          but it does not by itself discipline the anticipatory drift corridor
          where planning becomes prophecy-like closure or action-compulsion:
          Λ-collapse (uncertainty erased), Χ-erosion (stop-capability lost),
          Ω-instrumentalization (power used to enforce), and Ψ-externalization
          (binding shifted onto others). The ANTICIPATION overlay formalizes
          reversible planning as a present stance that carries Λ under Θ and
          keeps downstream planning explicitly gated by Χ + D + reversibility.

    context: >
      Agents (individuals, teams, institutions) must coordinate action under
      uncertainty. Planning is necessary, but commitments can create lock-in
      and expose affected parties asymmetrically. The core structural problem:
      how to plan while preserving revisability (Φ-availability) and stop-capability
      (Χ), i.e., avoiding premature irreversible commitments under Θ pressure.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Planning as scene-bound coordination inside an explicit role-space:
        declared horizon, stakes, constraints, and update triggers. Plans are
        provisional structures for coordination, not future-truth claims.
      protected_constraints:
        - "Plans are frame-bound (□): scope, stakes, failure modes, update criteria must be declared."
        - "Uncertainty is structurally persistent (Λ): planning must carry Λ rather than erase it."
        - "Reversibility is a validity condition: plans remain revisable under Φ where feasible."
        - "Distance (Χ) must remain active: no fusion into urgency, verdict, or action-compulsion."
        - "Integration (Σ) coordinates constraints and signals without totalization."
        - "Asymmetry (Ω) must be audited: who bears downside, who can revise, who cannot."
        - "Dignity-in-practice (D) constrains downstream use: no coercion, humiliation, or status-hardening."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Planning treated as prophecy (future certainty) rather than provisional coordination."
        - "Action mandates derived from probability rhetoric or plan existence alone."
        - "Governance/enforcement guidance (sanctions, coercive compliance regimes)."
        - "Global labels about persons/groups derived from plan adherence or non-adherence."
        - "Retroactive inevitability narratives ('it had to happen') erasing Λ."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "Days to years (explicitly declared horizon-dependent)."
      iteration_rhythm: "Regular review cycles; event-driven updates; after-action revision loops."
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "Documents, roadmaps, backlogs, institutional memory (Α stabilization)."
        - "Resource allocations and sunk costs (Θ lock-in amplifier)."
        - "Public commitments and reputational traces (Ψ-overbinding risk)."
      reversibility_window: >
        High early (options open), shrinking as commitments harden, resources
        are allocated, third parties are affected, and infrastructure is built.
        Reversibility is preserved by explicit exit ramps, modular commitments,
        and Φ-triggered update rules (structural, not prescriptive).
    roles:
      - role_label: "R₁ Planner / coordinator"
        function: "Integrates signals into a provisional plan; maintains update discipline."
        exposure_profile: "Carries accountability for lock-in effects under Θ and Ω."
        notes: "Risk: converting planning into authority; losing Χ under urgency."
      - role_label: "R₂ Implementers"
        function: "Enact plan components; surface deviations and feasibility constraints."
        exposure_profile: "Can become coerced by plan-as-verdict; bear operational downside."
        notes: "Not analyzed as psyches; only structural position and exposure."
      - role_label: "R₃ Affected parties / stakeholders"
        function: "Receive downstream consequences; may have limited voice or exit."
        exposure_profile: "Often highest exposure under Ω; dignity risk if plan becomes status-hardening."
        notes: "Key Ω-audit locus: who bears irreversible cost."
      - role_label: "R₄ Institutions / third parties (optional)"
        function: "Harden plans into policy, status, or gating; amplify Ω."
        exposure_profile: "Can reduce reversibility by embedding Σ into durable classifications."
        notes: "Primary corridor for Ω-instrumentalization + Ψ externalization."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Possible futures and paths differentiate: option A vs B, reversible steps vs
      irreversible commitments, bounded coordination vs totalizing program, local
      adjustments vs global lock-in.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Closure pressure to decide and commit: urgency, fear of missing windows (Θ),
      desire for control and predictability, social pressure for decisive action.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "No decisive evidence event arrives that guarantees plan success."
      - "No final closure event eliminates uncertainty; counterfactuals remain opaque."
      - "Expected feedback may be delayed or absent; signals remain incomplete."
      - "Regime shifts may occur: contexts change such that prior evidence loses relevance."

    reduced_signature: "Δ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Θ ∘ Χ (+ Φ; + Σ)"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        The plan is valid only inside a declared frame: horizon, stake, constraints,
        and update criteria. Frame-opacity is a drift risk (□ → 'reality itself').
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Planning allocates exposure: who takes downside, who gets exits, who gets
        veto power, who bears irreversible costs. Institutional embedding can
        amplify Ω by turning plans into enforceable status.
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ creates windows and lock-in: early reversibility, later path dependence,
        sunk costs, and reputational traces. Time pressure intensifies ∇ toward
        premature irreversible commitment.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ is structurally persistent: uncertainty cannot be eliminated. Reversible
        planning keeps Λ visible (assumptions, confidence bounds, unknowns) rather
        than laundering it into certainty.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Repeated planning cycles stabilize routines (Α): review rhythms, dashboards,
        and institutional narratives. This can support adaptation—or harden into
        rigidity that erases Λ.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ preserves revisability: new information or changed constraints trigger
        re-embedding of the plan into a new frame, avoiding narrative collapse or
        retroactive inevitability.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ coordinates constraints, signals, and partial commitments into a coherent
        but bounded plan. Σ must not totalize uncertainty into a single 'must-do'
        line; it remains compatible only with active Χ and visible Λ.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ binds the planners/users to update discipline and consequence ownership
        (who carries costs when wrong), not to being right and not to binding others
        by coercion.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ is stop-capability: prevents urgency from becoming compulsion, and blocks
        'plan existence' from becoming authority. Χ must remain active especially
        after partial success (post-confirmation drift risk).
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signatures are shorthand: PMS prerequisites remain authoritative.
      Χ depends on Φ/Θ/□; Σ depends on Χ/Φ; Ψ depends on Σ/Θ/Χ. Any configuration
      presenting Σ without Χ, Λ replaced by certainty, or Ψ externalized as imposed
      obligation indicates drift risk and is invalid as a PMS application.

        title: "Minimal anticipatory stance (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Δ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Θ ∘ Χ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Planning begins as a present stance: bounded possibilities inside a declared
          frame, carrying uncertainty over time with restraint. This forbids treating
          the plan as prophecy or as action-authorization.

        formula: "Δ ∘ ∇ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α ∘ Ω ∘ Θ ∘ Φ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ ∘ Ψ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Mature reversible planning disciplines closure pressure (∇), uses patterns
          (Α) without certainty conversion, audits exposure (Ω), respects lock-in (Θ),
          updates via Φ, maintains Χ, integrates via Σ without totalization, and binds
          responsibility inward via Ψ.
      - signature_id: "ANT_to_planning_constraint"
        title: "Constraint for any downstream planning / preparedness"
        formula: "requires Χ + D + reversibility"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Any downstream consequences (allocation, gating, sanctions, irreversible
          commitments) require explicit validity gates. Planning never supplies
          authority: probability does not become authorization.
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "certainty_replaces_Λ"
        label: "Λ replaced by certainty"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Plans invite narrative closure: ranges become guarantees, assumptions are
          hidden, and uncertainty budgets disappear—prophecy drift.
      - drift_id: "actionism_neutralizes_Θ"
        label: "Θ neutralized by action compulsion"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Time pressure turns planning into compulsion: 'we must act now' collapses
          revisability and denies lock-in consequences.
      - drift_id: "Χ_suspended"
        label: "Χ suspended ('I know better')"
        why_plausible_here: >
          After partial success or strong institutional backing, stop-capability erodes;
          the plan becomes verdict and dissent becomes treated as illegitimate.
      - drift_id: "Ω_instrumentalized"
        label: "Ω instrumentalized"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Plans become control levers: compliance is enforced, exposure is externalized,
          and affected parties lose reversibility and standing.
      - drift_id: "Ψ_externalized"
        label: "Ψ externalized ('others must comply now')"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Binding is shifted outward: the plan becomes an imposed obligation, with
          proof-demands and penalties for non-alignment.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      The overlay distinguishes reversible planning (Λ-carrying stance with Φ+Χ)
      from prophecy-like closure and action-compulsion. It supplies formal drift
      markers for probability → authorization, post-confirmation Χ-erosion, and
      institutional Ω-instrumentalization when plans harden into status.

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Planning redistributes risk: decision-makers may retain upside while affected
      parties carry downside, especially when exit options are unequal. Institutional
      adoption can amplify Ω by converting provisional stances into enforceable status.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Commitments create path dependence: sunk costs, infrastructure, public promises,
      and reputational traces shrink the reversibility window. The more Σ is embedded
      into durable policy, the higher the Θ-lock-in.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Unknowns persist: incomplete data, regime shifts, counterfactual opacity.
      Attempts to erase Λ typically substitute brittle certainty narratives and
      increase coercion drift risk.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Declare the planning frame (□): scope, horizon, stakes, constraints, update triggers."
      - "Carry Λ explicitly: keep uncertainty budgets visible; do not launder uncertainty into guarantees."
      - "Maintain Φ availability: treat recontextualization as a built-in condition of planning."
      - "Maintain Χ under stress and after partial success: block compulsion and authority conversion."
      - "Use Α as stabilization without prophecy: rely on repeated review/feedback loops, not single-shot closure."
      - "Integrate via Σ without totalization: coherent coordination with explicit remainder and limits."
      - "Bind inward via Ψ: commit to update discipline and consequence ownership, not to coercing others."
      - "Audit Ω and preserve D: identify who bears irreversible cost; prevent humiliation, exclusion, or coercion."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Planning outputs are used to justify coercion, humiliation, exclusion, or
      surveillance—especially when institutions harden plans into status and when
      affected parties have limited exit.
    structural_indicator: >
      Λ is denied (certainty substituted), Χ collapses (stop-capability lost),
      Ω becomes leverage, Σ hardens into irreversible classification, and Ψ is
      externalized as imposed obligation.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "A method for guaranteeing success or eliminating uncertainty."
      - "Action mandates derived from plan existence or probability rhetoric."
      - "Governance/enforcement guidance (sanctions, coercive compliance regimes)."
      - "Person evaluation, intent attribution, or moral ranking."
      - "Prophecy-like future-truth claims."
    claimed:
      - "Reversible planning is a Λ-carrying stance under Θ inside explicit frames (□) with active Χ and Φ availability."
      - "Lock-in is a Θ effect amplified by Α, Σ, and institutional embedding; reversibility windows shrink structurally."
      - "Planning is PMS-valid only when probability does not become authorization and when D is preserved under Ω."
      - "Self-binding (Ψ) binds planners/users to update discipline and consequence ownership, not to coercing others."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not treat plans as prophecy, do not convert uncertainty into compulsion,
      and do not use planning as a warrant for domination, humiliation, exclusion,
      or irreversible status-hardening. Do not externalize Ψ as imposed obligation.

  structural_closure: >
    Reversible planning is specified as a configuration where bounded possibilities
    (Δ in □) are integrated (Σ) into provisional coordination across time (Θ) while
    uncertainty remains structurally active (Λ). PMS–ANTICIPATION closes the case
    by enforcing boundary discipline: maintain Χ (stop-capability), keep Φ-driven
    revision available, audit Ω exposure, preserve D in downstream handling, and
    bind responsibility inward via Ψ rather than converting planning into prophecy
    or authority.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Planning is useful, but it can’t make the future certain. Reversible planning
    means you plan in a way that keeps uncertainty explicit and keeps you able to
    revise when new information or changed conditions arrive. The danger is when
    plans start being treated like destiny—or like a reason to force others to
    comply. This case treats good planning as stable-but-revisable coordination
    under real time pressure and real asymmetry, with clear limits, update readiness,
    and respect for those who bear the downside.
