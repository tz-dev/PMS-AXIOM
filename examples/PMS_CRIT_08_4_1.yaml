        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can represent framed mismatch (Δ under □), recontextualization (Φ),
          integration (Σ), binding (Ψ), and the pricing of distance (Χ) under asymmetry/time (Ω/Θ).
          But PMS core alone does not explicitly formalize critique-specific failure modes where
          critique language travels across scale boundaries (micro → macro) and converts into
          authority, exposure, or sanction substitutes. The CRITIQUE overlay adds an explicit
          reach ladder (V0–V4), a scale ladder (a–d) with publicness overlay P, and a drift
          typology that keeps “reach” descriptive rather than moralized or legitimating.

    context: >
      A critique episode begins in a micro-context (dyadic or small group) and is then
      re-used to justify macro-level claims (about groups, institutions, publics), or to
      escalate public exposure. The central question is how far critique can travel
      without laundering authority, overgeneralizing, or substituting exposure for correction.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        "Within which frame is the mismatch legible, and what is the valid target-level
        of critique (scene / role / practice / policy) before escalation becomes a category error?"
      protected_constraints:
        - "Critique remains an analysis of framed mismatch, not a person verdict."
        - "Reach and scale are descriptive (no virtue ladder, no legitimacy grant)."
        - "Stop-capability (Χ) must remain practically activatable without penalty."
        - "Any cross-scale move must keep reversibility and D (dignity-in-practice)."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Adjudicating who is right."
        - "Diagnosing motives, traits, or sincerity."
        - "Sanction design, punishment, or exclusion rules."
        - "Global person labels or group ranking."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "hours → weeks"
      iteration_rhythm: "repeatable reuse of a critique snippet across contexts"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "quoting / forwarding / screenshotting"
        - "searchability and durable reputational traces"
        - "institutional memory and documentation"
      reversibility_window: >
        "Often narrow once publicness overlay P is activated; revision becomes costly and
        residual traces persist even after corrections."

        function: "Critique originator (micro-raiser)"
        exposure_profile: "often bears local relationship cost and later public backlash risk"

      - role_label: "R3"
        function: "Amplifier / re-user (group, audience, institution, platform dynamics)"
        exposure_profile: "often low direct cost; can steepen Ω gradients by broadcasting"
        notes: "can activate P overlay; can replace Σ/Ψ with exposure"
      - role_label: "R4"
        function: "Audience / public / governance consumers"
        exposure_profile: "diffuse; can stabilize Α scripts (pile-on, silence, performative alignment)"
        notes: "collective effects appear without a single accountable agent"

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      A mismatch is registered in a micro-scene (claim vs standard; behavior vs expectation;
      promise vs non-event). The mismatch is then treated as evidence for a macro claim
      ("this is how the organization is", "this group is like this") or as warrant for public exposure.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Pressure to escalate and close: demand for immediate clarity, recognition, or settlement;
      urgency increases under public attention and time compression (Θ), pushing toward reaction (Δ+∇)
      or judgment (□+Δ without Φ/Σ).
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "No explicit reach-boundary is stated (missing □ boundary for target-level)."
      - "No protected revision window is provided after escalation (Χ becomes priced)."
      - "No consolidatable corrective step is proposed (Σ absent; talk substitutes for correction)."
      - "No follow-up ownership is defined (Ψ absent; diffusion across roles)."

  operator_mapping:
    operator_chain: ["Ψ","Σ","Χ","Φ","Θ","Ω","Α","Λ","□","∇","Δ"]
    reduced_signature: "Δ ∘ □ ∘ Χ ∘ (Φ/Σ optional) ∘ (Ω/Θ amplified under scale; P possible) ∘ (Ψ for stable follow-up)"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        The frame must specify the critique target-level (scene/role/practice/policy) and the
        permissible generalization step. Without □ clarity, “micro evidence → macro verdict” becomes
        an untracked frame shift.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Cross-scale moves steepen exposure gradients: amplifiers can impose costs (Ω) without bearing
        them, while targets lose control of context. Authority laundering becomes plausible when Ω is
        treated as entitlement to define meaning or impose outcomes.
      theta_temporality: >
        Publicness and documentation harden residue: the critique snippet persists, becomes reusable,
        and shrinks reversibility windows. Time compression increases drift sensitivity.
      lambda_residue: >
        Missing boundaries, missing follow-up, and missing revision rights accumulate as Λ load:
        the absence itself becomes “evidence,” even if it is structurally produced by priced Χ.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Reuse patterns stabilize quickly: pile-on scripts, silence scripts, “tone policing,”
        performative alignment, and process-talk loops can become default handling (Α).
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ is necessary for legitimate cross-scale interpretation (moving from a local event to
        structural conditions), but becomes drift when it turns into narrative reset (Φ high, Σ absent).
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ marks whether critique yields a coordinatable corrective step. Without Σ, escalation often
        substitutes exposure or labeling for correction.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ is required for stable critique: ownership of follow-up over time without coercion.
        Invalid form: converting binding into demands on others (Ψ→Other) or into sanction logic.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ is the interruptibility condition. Micro→macro drift typically coincides with priced Χ:
        once publicness is triggered, stopping/revising becomes costly or socially penalized.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      χ-language is not a trait claim: Χ depends on Φ/Θ/□ conditions and is itself priced by Ω/Θ.
      Any analysis that treats “loss of Χ” as personal deficiency violates PMS/CRITIQUE scope discipline.

        title: "Minimal Critique"
        formula: "Δ + □ + Χ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          The case starts from a micro mismatch that is legible and interruptible inside a local frame.
          The key issue is whether this minimal configuration is preserved when critique travels upward.
      - signature_id: "CRITIQUE_PROD"
        title: "Productive Critique"
        formula: "Δ + □ + Χ + Φ + Σ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Legitimate micro→macro movement requires Φ to relocate the mismatch into the correct target-level
          and Σ to consolidate a corrective step. Without Σ, “scale-up” becomes narrative or exposure.
      - signature_id: "CRITIQUE_STABLE"
        title: "Stable Critique"
        formula: "Δ + □ + Χ + Φ + Σ + Ψ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          If cross-scale critique is to remain responsible, follow-up ownership must exist (Ψ) while keeping
          non-coercion and revisability. This prevents critique language from becoming authority.
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "C2"
        label: "Judgment Drift"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Cross-scale critique tends to replace correction with labels: □+Δ becomes evaluative closure while Φ/Σ
          remain absent, and Ω gradients make the label stick.
      - drift_id: "C4"
        label: "Narrative Reset Drift"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Micro evidence is repeatedly recontextualized (Φ) into macro stories without producing a consolidatable
          corrective step (Σ), creating a stable explanation loop.
      - drift_id: "C7"
        label: "Diffusion Drift"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Responsibility for follow-up diffuses as scale increases: many actors can amplify, few can own Ψ.
      - drift_id: "C8"
        label: "Public Pillory"
        why_plausible_here: >
          If publicness overlay P activates, Ω/Θ/Α amplify: exposure becomes the “action,” critique fuses with degradation,
          and revision (Χ) becomes priced or impossible.
      - drift_id: "C6"
        label: "Silence-as-Steering"
        why_plausible_here: >
          When escalation costs are high, actors avoid interruption; Λ persists, stabilizing a silence script (Α) that later
          gets reframed as complicity or “evidence.”
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      The overlay makes “reach” explicit: it separates critique levels (V0–V4) from scale conditions (a–d) and highlights
      the publicness overlay P as an amplifier of Ω/Θ/Α. This prevents a common laundering move: treating increased reach
      or increased publicness as inherently “stronger” or “more legitimate” critique.

  drift_classification:
    drift_present: true
    drift_label: "Reach laundering (micro→macro escalation without trackable Φ/Σ/Ψ)"
    minimal_drift_signature: "Δ present / □ shifts across scale / Χ priced / Φ high or absent / Σ absent / Ω & Θ amplified (often under P)"
    observable_markers:
      - "Micro episode is cited as macro evidence without explicit frame boundary."
      - "Escalation occurs faster than correction design (tempo pressure)."
      - "Exposure increases while actionability decreases (label replaces fix)."
      - "Stop/revision attempts are penalized or treated as evasion (priced Χ)."
      - "Follow-up ownership is diffuse; no audit-able Ψ anchors."

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      As scale increases, amplifiers can impose reputational or institutional costs with low personal exposure,
      while targets and originators bear durable costs. Ω steepens most under publicness overlay P.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Public traces harden quickly; once the critique is reusable as a macro token, later corrections cannot fully
      erase residue. Time compression also increases reaction drift probability.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Missing boundaries, missing follow-up, and missing revision rights accumulate as Λ load and are then re-read
      as evidence—creating a self-reinforcing loop.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Escalating to publicness when local frames block Χ or when retaliation risk makes micro repair non-viable."
      - "Avoiding Σ commitments when any concrete proposal would increase exposure or become permanently contestable."
      - "Defaulting to scripts (Α) such as silence, pile-on, or process-talk under high Ω/Θ load."
      - "Reframing (Φ) to protect face or legitimacy when integration is infeasible in the current frame."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      The critical risk is substituting public exposure or categorical labeling for correction, turning critique into
      degradation or sorting under steep Ω gradients (especially under P).
    structural_indicator: >
      D collapse is indicated when interruption rights (Χ) are socially unavailable, and the only remaining “critique move”
      is exposure, humiliation, or irreversible attribution—i.e., critique produces harm without an actionable Σ corridor.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "That the micro claim is true or false."
      - "That escalation is morally justified or unjustified."
      - "That any actor has a particular motive, trait, or pathology."
      - "That publicness is inherently good or bad."
    claimed:
      - "Micro→macro moves require explicit frame tracking; otherwise reach laundering is structurally likely."
      - "Scale changes the cost and viability of Χ/Σ/Ψ without changing operator grammar."
      - "Publicness overlay P amplifies Ω/Θ/Α and increases drift sensitivity."
      - "Without Σ and Ψ, critique language tends to convert into judgment, narrative reset, or exposure substitutes."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use this case to justify sanction, exclusion, hiring/firing, or reputational punishment.
      Do not use drift labels as moral tokens. Do not convert “reach” into authority. If governance decisions
      are at stake, shift mode explicitly to MIP and enforce artifact-level evaluation safeguards.

  structural_closure: >
    Critique reach is structurally limited: as critique travels from micro to macro, the decisive variables are not
    “strength” or “rightness” but the availability of interruption (Χ), the existence of an actionable integration step (Σ),
    and non-coercive follow-up ownership (Ψ) under scale-amplified exposure and temporality (Ω/Θ), often intensified by
    publicness overlay P. The responsible endpoint is a reach policy and/or disclosure rule that keeps critique descriptive,
    bounded, revisable, and dignity-constrained, rather than laundering authority or substituting exposure for correction.

  plain_language_summary: >
    This case asks how far a critique can responsibly “travel” from a local situation to bigger claims about systems or
    groups. The key is not whether the critique feels strong, but whether the discussion stays interruptible (you can pause
    and revise), whether it produces a concrete corrective step, and whether someone owns follow-up without coercing others.
    When critique becomes public, exposure and irreversibility rise quickly, and common drift forms appear: fast reaction,
    labeling instead of fixing, endless reframing, silence, or public shaming. The output is a reach boundary and, when
    relevant, a rule for what may be disclosed publicly—so critique does not silently turn into authority or punishment.
