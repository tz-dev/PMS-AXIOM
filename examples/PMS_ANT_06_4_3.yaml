        why_this_addon: >
          PMS-core can represent framing (□), non-event structure (Λ), patterns (Α),
          temporality (Θ), and asymmetry (Ω), but it does not by itself formalize the
          anticipation-specific boundary discipline that prevents forecasting from drifting
          into prophecy: Λ-collapse into certainty, Χ-erosion after being right, probability →
          action-compulsion, and probability → authority. The ANTICIPATION overlay
          explicitly treats forecasting as descriptive input that must be reprocessed as a
          present stance carrying Λ under Θ, with explicit invalidity markers for
          authorization drift.

  scene_packet:
    scene_id: "SCENE_forecasting_vs_prophecy"
    context: >
      Forecasting in science, risk management, economics, weather, engineering, or
      organizational planning: models produce probabilistic projections under uncertainty.
      The scene concerns the structural transition from "forecast as bounded input"
      to "forecast treated as settled future truth" (prophecy drift), often under
      asymmetric stakes and time pressure.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Forecasts are frame-bound, probabilistic orientation tools for coordination within
        explicitly declared scope: what is being forecast, over what horizon (Θ), using
        which evidence class (Δ), and with what claim-strength (□).
      protected_constraints:
        - "Forecasts are distributions / ranges, not guarantees (no necessity claim)."
        - "Uncertainty is carried explicitly (Λ remains structurally active)."
        - "Calibration is scene-bound: performance is assessed within declared frames (□)."
        - "Reversibility: forecasts and downstream stances remain revisable under new data (Φ)."
        - "Distance (Χ) is maintained: 'likely' does not become 'authorized'."
        - "Integration (Σ) coordinates multiple signals and models without totalization."
        - "If stakes distribute unevenly, Ω must be audited and D preserved."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Prophetic closure: 'this will happen' treated as settled truth independent of frame."
        - "Authority conversion: forecasting success used as entitlement to rule/compel."
        - "Action mandates justified by forecast alone ('must act because the model says')."
        - "Retroactive inevitability narratives (Λ-denial after outcomes)."
        - "Global labels about persons or groups based on forecasted behavior."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "Short-run to long-run horizons; horizon-dependent and explicitly declared."
      iteration_rhythm: "Update cycles: daily/weekly/monthly; re-forecasting under new evidence."
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "Model update pipelines and recurring reporting routines (Α-stabilization)."
        - "Institutional memory and dashboards that fix forecasts into common reference points."
        - "Decision commitments that create path dependence (Θ lock-in)."
      reversibility_window: >
        Revision remains available while frames remain updateable (Φ) and commitments are not
        irreversibly externalized. Irreversibility increases when forecasts are embedded into
        policy, infrastructure, or public identity claims (Ψ overbinding).
    roles:
      - role_label: "R1_modeler_forecaster"
        function: "Produces forecast outputs under a declared frame (□) and update discipline (Φ)."
        exposure_profile: "Reputational exposure; risk of Ω-inflation if outputs are treated as authority."
        notes: "Not analyzed as a person; role is structural."
      - role_label: "R2_decision_user"
        function: "Consumes forecasts for coordination; integrates them with other constraints (Σ)."
        exposure_profile: "Bears operational costs under Θ; vulnerable to action-compulsion drift."
        notes: "May be an individual, team, or institution."
      - role_label: "R3_affected_parties"
        function: "Carry downstream consequences when forecasts inform policy or allocation."
        exposure_profile: "Often highest exposure under Ω; dignity risks if treated as objects of control."
        notes: "Included whenever forecasts shape constraints on others."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Signal vs noise; model fit vs misfit; calibrated uncertainty bands vs deterministic claims;
      bounded scenario statements vs global future-truth assertions.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Closure pressure: the drive to eliminate uncertainty, to decide fast, to justify action,
      and to treat predictive success as warrant for certainty or authority.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "No event occurs that converts probabilistic projection into necessity (warrant gap persists)."
      - "No final confirmation arrives that removes model uncertainty for future contexts."
      - "Rare/black-swan deviations remain structurally possible despite past success."
      - "Counterfactuals remain untestable (what would have happened under different actions)."

    reduced_signature: "Δ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Θ ∘ Χ  (+ Α; + Σ)"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        Forecasting is valid only inside declared frames: variable, horizon, evidence scope,
        and claim-strength. Frame opacity is a drift risk (□ hardening into 'reality itself').
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Forecasts often allocate exposure: who bears downside if wrong, who benefits if right.
        Under institutional use, Ω can inflate into coercive leverage unless constrained by D and Χ.
      theta_temporality: >
        Forecasts are Θ-structured: horizons, closing windows, and lock-in dynamics.
        Time pressure increases ∇ and encourages prophecy drift.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ is central: uncertainty is not a defect to erase but a boundary condition.
        Prophecy drift occurs when Λ is replaced by certainty narratives.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Repeated predictive success stabilizes routines (Α) and can harden into "it works → it is true"
        unless Χ and Φ remain active.
      recontext_phi: >
        New data, regime shifts, or context changes require Φ: updating models and sometimes reframing
        what counts as evidence or relevance (□).
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ integrates multiple models, signals, and constraints into a bounded stance (uncertainty budgets),
        not into totalized certainty.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ binds the forecaster/user to update discipline and responsibility for consequences—not to being right,
        and not as a mandate imposed on others.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ is the stop-capability that blocks probability → authorization and success → superiority.
        It must remain active especially after confirmation.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signatures are shorthand. PMS prerequisites remain authoritative (Χ depends on Φ/Θ/□;
      Σ depends on Χ/Φ; Ψ depends on Σ/Θ/Χ). Any configuration showing "certainty replacing Λ",
      "Σ without Χ", or "Ψ externalized as obligation" indicates drift risk and is invalid as a PMS application.

        formula: "Δ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Θ ∘ Χ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Forecasting is treated as a present stance: bounded projections carried as non-closure
          over time with maintained restraint—explicitly not action-authorizing.

        formula: "Δ ∘ ∇ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α ∘ Ω ∘ Θ ∘ Φ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ ∘ Ψ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Mature forecasting practice: impulse toward closure (∇) is regulated; patterns (Α) are used without
          certainty conversion; exposure (Ω) is audited; time (Θ) is respected; models/frames update (Φ);
          distance (Χ) remains; integration (Σ) stays non-totalizing; self-binding (Ψ) binds update discipline.

        title: "Constraint for any downstream planning / preparedness"
        formula: "requires Χ + D + reversibility"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          When forecasts drive downstream commitments (resource allocation, sanctions, access rules),
          explicit validity gates must hold. Forecasts may inform planning, but cannot supply authority.

      - drift_id: "certainty_replaces_Λ"
        label: "Λ replaced by certainty (prophecy drift)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Strong narratives, impressive models, or repeated success invite treating the forecast as settled future truth,
          suppressing uncertainty budgets and revision rights.
      - drift_id: "actionism_neutralizes_Θ"
        label: "Θ neutralized by action-compulsion"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Time pressure and high stakes turn probabilistic language into compulsory immediacy ("we must act now"),
          collapsing deliberation and reversibility.
      - drift_id: "Ω_instrumentalized"
        label: "Ω instrumentalized (forecast → coercive leverage)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Institutions may convert forecasts into control tools (allocation, exclusion, surveillance),
          shifting uncertainty burdens onto vulnerable parties and eroding D.
      - drift_id: "Ψ_externalized"
        label: "Ψ externalized (others must comply)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Forecast outputs become imposed obligations or proof-demands on others, turning stance into enforcement
          and betraying the self-binding requirement.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      The overlay clarifies the structural boundary between descriptive forecasting and prophetic closure:
      it formalizes invalidity markers where Λ collapses into certainty, where probability becomes authorization,
      and where confirmation erodes Χ. It also makes explicit the post-confirmation obligation: restore distance
      and refuse authority conversion under Ω.

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Forecast users and affected parties often bear different costs: decision-makers may externalize downside,
      while impacted groups carry irreversible consequences. Institutional use can amplify Ω and dignity risks.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Forecast-informed commitments create path dependence: infrastructure, policy, and reputational narratives
      harden, making later revision costly even when Φ signals regime change.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Irreducible uncertainty persists: model risk, unobserved variables, and counterfactual opacity remain.
      Attempts to erase Λ usually substitute brittle certainty narratives and raise drift risk.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Declare the operative frame (□): scope, horizon (Θ), evidence class, and claim-strength."
      - "Carry Λ explicitly: state uncertainty budgets; do not convert forecasts into guarantees."
      - "Prefer calibration loops (Α + Φ): update forecasts and sometimes frames as conditions change."
      - "Maintain Χ under stress and after confirmation: block probability → authorization."
      - "Integrate via Σ without totalization: combine models/signals while keeping remainder explicit."
      - "Audit Ω: identify who bears downside; preserve D in downstream handling."
      - "Bind inward via Ψ: commit to update discipline and consequence ownership, not to superiority claims."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Forecast outputs are used to justify coercion, humiliation, exclusion, or surveillance—especially when
      uncertainty is framed as defect or guilt and when third parties institutionalize the forecast as status.
    structural_indicator: >
      Λ is denied (certainty substituted), Χ collapses, Ω becomes leverage, Σ hardens into irreversible classification,
      and Ψ is externalized as imposed obligation.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "A prophecy or future-truth guarantee."
      - "An action mandate justified by forecast alone."
      - "A method for person evaluation, intent attribution, or moral ranking."
      - "A governance/enforcement recipe or control protocol."
      - "Elimination of uncertainty or final closure of Λ."
    claimed:
      - "Forecasting is structurally a frame-bound orientation practice under persistent Λ over Θ."
      - "Prophecy drift is a recognizable configuration: Λ-collapse, Χ-erosion, and probability → authorization."
      - "Viable forecasting requires Φ-driven revision, Χ maintenance, Σ non-totalization, and Ω/D discipline."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use forecasts to manufacture certainty, compel action, or convert predictive success into authority.
      Do not externalize Ψ as obligations imposed on others. Treat affected parties under Ω with D and preserve
      reversibility wherever possible.

  structural_closure: >
    Forecasting without prophecy is specified as a configuration where bounded projections (Δ in □) stabilize
    patterns (Α) over time (Θ) while uncertainty remains structurally active (Λ). PMS–ANTICIPATION closes the case
    by enforcing boundary discipline: carry Λ explicitly, maintain Χ against certainty and authority conversion,
    update through Φ, integrate via Σ without totalization, audit Ω exposure, and bind responsibility inward via Ψ
    rather than externalizing obligation.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Forecasts can be useful without pretending to be destiny. They help us orient by giving bounded, revisable
    expectations over time—but they never remove uncertainty completely. This case treats “prophecy” as a drift:
    when people start talking as if a forecast is guaranteed, or as if probability gives them the right to compel
    others. The disciplined move is to keep the frame and uncertainty explicit, stay update-ready, and avoid using
    predictive success as a shortcut to authority.
