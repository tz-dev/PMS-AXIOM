    short_case_description: |
      A sexual interaction takes place under a salient power/exposure gradient (Ω). Consent language may be present, but the frame (□) is ambiguous and the practical availability of stopping (Χ) is uncertain or socially priced. The analysis treats consent as a configuration-validity property across Ω/Θ/Λ/Χ, not as a single utterance, and tracks drift preparation markers such as covert Ψ demands, Λ-as-steering, and Θ accumulation denied via exit fictions.

      - "R2_higher_exposure_lower_leverage_position"
    guiding_question: |
      Under which structural conditions does “consent talk” remain configuration-valid under asymmetry—i.e., with explicit □, nameable/regulable Ω, Θ realism, Λ tolerance, and operative Χ—rather than drifting into a label that masks Χ loss, Ω steering, or covert Ψ demands?

  role_mapping:
    object_of_observation:
      type: "practice_pattern"
      label: "Consent under asymmetry as configuration-validity gate (□/Ω/Θ/Λ/Χ)"
      description: |
        A structural pattern where consent language is used inside a scene with salient Ω gradients. Validity requires explicit framing (□), regulable asymmetry (Ω), temporality realism (Θ), tolerance for non-events like hesitation/withdrawal (Λ), and practically operative stopping (Χ). Drift risk rises when Ω becomes steering, Χ is priced/punished, Λ becomes instrumentally active, or Ψ-relevant stakes enter covertly.
    other_relevant_roles:
      - role_label: "R1_higher_leverage_lower_exposure_position"
        function: "Controls pace/access or defaults inside the frame; can make □ explicit and keep Χ operative."

    analyst_role:
      description: "Template-level structural analyst; not adjudicating legal guilt, intent, or prescribing behavior."
      power_position_reflection: |
        Analyst language can itself create tribunal dynamics or irreversible labels in a high-stakes domain. This reading stays role-bound and configuration-focused, avoids person claims, and treats misuse (public shaming/coercion/permission logic) as an IA/D artifact risk.
    publicity_degree: "variable (parameterized)"

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: |
      - Consent is treated as a configuration-validity claim requiring □ explicitness, regulable Ω, Θ realism, Λ tolerance, and operative Χ.
      - Protected constraint: no person evaluation, no intent attribution, no moral ranking; no legal/forensic determinations.
      - Protected constraint: no prescriptive sexual guidance or enforcement heuristics; no “permission” logic.
      - D0 is untouchable; D module remains OFF; dignity is protected structurally via anti-shaming and scene-bound language.
    variable_elements: |
      - Embedding: one-off vs recurrent interaction; relationship vs anonymous context; presence/absence of institutional roles.
      - Publicness/records coupling: private vs institutional records vs public narration/media amplification.
      - Channel control: who can pause/stop, ask questions, renegotiate, exit, or escalate; what is socially priced.
      - Norm frame: what counts as a valid boundary signal, what counts as “stop,” what counts as consent language in this setting.
      - Integration (Σ) pathways: whether clarification/repair windows exist and are safe to invoke.
    unfair_high_M_zones: |
      - Where R2 has constrained alternatives/high dependency and Χ is priced or practically unavailable, assigning high M for “not stopping” or “not clarifying” is unfair.
      - Where the frame (□) is ambiguous by design and Ω cannot be named without penalty, individual responsibility ceilings apply; structural/institutional co-responsibility rises.
      - Where Θ accumulation and reputational stakes are amplified by publicness/records, simplistic “you could have stopped anytime” readings are structurally invalid.
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: |
      - “Consent was said” used as a blanket shield while Χ was non-operative in practice.
      - “You can stop anytime” asserted while social/institutional pricing makes Χ functionally unavailable.
      - “It was just a local scene” used to deny Θ realism (after-effects, accumulation, reputational stakes).
      - “No means no only” used to erase Λ tolerance (hesitation/withdrawal treated as unacceptable), increasing steering pressure.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: |
        Actors may recognize that “consent” is being referenced, but not recognize that validity depends on configuration conditions: frame explicitness (□), real stop-capability (Χ), and regulable Ω under Θ realism. Under ∇ urgency, awareness can narrow to local utterances rather than carrier conditions.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: |
        Ambiguity around boundaries; hesitation/withdrawal treated as disruptive; avoidance of naming Ω; “you can stop anytime” rhetoric paired with subtle penalties; reframing (Φ) used to reset meaning without integration (Σ); repetition scripts (Α) developing.
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: |
        Confusing a consent utterance with configuration validity; treating Λ (pause/hesitation) as illegible or unacceptable; denying Ω gradients; treating exit as frictionless despite Θ costs; importing Ψ stakes covertly while claiming non-bindingness.
    coherence:
      official_narratives: |
        “Consent was given.” “You can stop anytime.” “It’s casual / not that serious.” “We don’t need to define it.”
        (Optional institutional variant) “Policy boxes checked, therefore valid.”
      visible_enactments: |
        Consent language present; boundary negotiation uneven; stopping/pausing is socially costly or unclear; reframing (Φ) used to smooth tension; explicit integration (Σ) may be absent; scripts (Α) can stabilize, reducing alternatives over time.
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: |
        Coherence breaks when verbal consent is emphasized while Χ is non-operative, Λ signals are pressured, Ω is denied, or covert Ψ demands enter a non-binding frame. A “stop is available” claim becomes incoherent if stopping is punished or priced.
    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: |
        - Make □ explicit: what counts as boundary, refusal, stopping, and what is out of scope.
        - Keep Χ operative: stopping and meta-position must be practically available without punishment.
        - Name/regulate Ω: treat asymmetry as a managed gradient, not as denied pseudo-symmetry.
        - Tolerate Λ: hesitation/withdrawal must be structurally tolerable without leverage pressure.
        - Prevent Ψ leak: avoid covert binding/meaning demands under a frame narrated as non-binding.
        - Treat Θ as real: after-effects and accumulation must be accounted for; avoid exit fictions.
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: |
        Responsibility can be laundered into local utterance logic (“a word was said”) while configuration conditions are ignored; or into pseudo-symmetry narratives that deny Ω. In other drift, responsibility is displaced into coercive framing or reputational threat.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: |
        When configuration validity fails, ambiguity hardens into Θ accumulation (after-effects, reputational stakes), scripts (Α) stabilize, and future scenes become less reversible. Third parties may adopt harmful heuristics (“consent word = always valid”) or tribunal dynamics.
    power:
      formal_power_distribution: |
        Variable: can be role-based authority, social standing, dependency, or situational control (space, access, pace). Formal authority is not required for strong Ω.
      factual_power_distribution: |
        Power concentrates in channel control: who sets pace, who defines “normal,” who can reframe (Φ) credibly, who can punish pauses, and who controls escalation/publicness. Ω steepens when exit is costly and Θ consequences accumulate.
      used_alternatives: |
        - Proceeding under ambiguity due to ∇ pressure and high cost of activating Χ.
        - Using pseudo-symmetry rhetoric to stabilize the frame without naming Ω.
        - Using Φ reframing to reduce tension when Σ integration is hard or unsafe.
        - Relying on scripts (Α) rather than explicit negotiation.
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: |
        - Explicit “stop-safe” framing (□) with clear boundary/stopping semantics.
        - Low-cost pause/clarification windows (Χ protection) that are socially safe.
        - Minimal Σ integration steps: pace adjustment, boundary confirmation, repair check-ins.
        - Time-bounded review (TB) for recurring interactions: explicit revisit checkpoints.
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: |
        D module remains OFF. D risk is handled structurally: prevent shaming/tribunal drift and avoid any person-level dignity profiling; keep the reading scene-bound and reversible.

  ia_protection:
    transparency_measures: |
      - Define consent as configuration-validity (□/Ω/Θ/Λ/Χ), not utterance proof.
      - Map Ω gradients explicitly (access, exposure, dependency, leverage) without moralization.
      - Specify what counts as stopping (Χ) and what counts as boundary signals (including Λ events).
      - Flag drift markers: Ψ leak, Ω-as-steering, Λ-as-steering, Χ loss/pricing, Θ exit fictions.
    time_bound_measures: |
      - For recurrent interactions: install review checkpoints (TB) to revisit □ clarity and Χ operativity after N cycles/time windows.
      - Treat “local reset” claims as TB-trigger candidates: if Θ costs accumulate, require explicit re-framing rather than assumed closure.
    reversibility_measures: |
      - Protect Χ: pause/stop must be practically available without punishment; ensure meta-position is structurally tolerable.
      - Provide a minimal Σ pathway: if ambiguity recurs, require at least one integration move (pace adjustment, boundary confirmation, repair check-in).
      - If publicness/records exist: prevent exposure dynamics; keep any documentation strictly structure-only and correction-ready.

    course_in_words: |
      The pattern begins as a local interaction where explicit framing and stop-capability could still be secured. Under ∇ urgency, configuration conditions can be skipped, turning ambiguity into functional steering.
      If Λ events are not tolerable and Χ is priced, scripts stabilize (Α) and Θ accumulation makes later correction harder; consent language becomes a masking label rather than a validity description.
    responsibility_viability_range: |
      Viability is highest when □ is explicit, Ω is nameable/regulable, Θ is treated as real, Λ is tolerable, and Χ remains operative (with Σ reachable for integration).
      Viability collapses when Ω is denied, Χ is non-operative, Λ becomes leverage, and Ψ stakes enter covertly while Θ accumulation is minimized via exit fictions.

    unclear_points: |
      - What is the concrete embedding (one-off vs recurrent; relationship vs institutional role context) and what norm frame is assumed?
      - What is the practical availability of Χ: can stopping/pause occur without penalty; what is socially priced?
      - Which Ω gradients are present (dependency, standing, access control) and are they nameable within □?
      - Is there any Σ integration pathway (clarification/repair) that is safe to invoke, and what triggers it?
      - Is there a publicness/records coupling that steepens Ω and hardens Θ?
    missing_data_or_perspectives: |
      - Higher-exposure role perspective: real alternatives, perceived pricing of Χ, and what counts as a safe boundary signal.
      - Higher-leverage role perspective: willingness to slow/clarify, to accept Λ, and to avoid covert Ψ demands.
      - Optional institutional/audience perspective: what is rewarded/punished, and how narratives harden via documentation.
    distortion_risks: |
      - Moralization drift (turning validity constraints into virtue/vice judgments).
      - Overfitting to coercion narratives where ambiguity is genuine and handled well.
      - Under-weighting how publicness/records can harden Θ and distort “exit realism.”

  biases_case_level:
    initial_intuition: |
      Consent language can function as a masking label under asymmetry: if Χ is not practically available and Ω cannot be named, the label may conceal steering dynamics rather than describe validity. This is treated as a hypothesis, not a verdict.
    named_bias_risks:
      - "negativity_bias"
      - "hindsight_bias"
      - "abstraction_bias"
      - "norm_frame_bias"
      - "scope_leakage_risk"
    counter_reading_outline: |
      Counter-reading: Many asymmetric configurations can still be validity-preserving when □ is explicit, Ω is regulable, Λ is tolerated, Χ is operative in practice, and Θ accumulation is acknowledged. In such cases, limiting narrative inflation and avoiding tribunal framings may protect dignity and prevent misuse; the same structural vocabulary should not be used to infer coercion absent concrete markers of Χ loss, Λ steering, or covert Ψ demands.

  analyst_reflection:
    self_implication_notes: |
      This domain is high-risk for misuse and for collapsing structural analysis into person judgement. The analyst’s language can become a tribunal tool or a permission device. Therefore the reading stays configuration-level, avoids advice scripts, and keeps D module OFF while treating dignity protection as a structural constraint.
    possible_next_steps: |
      - Add one concrete vignette and separate observed events (□ clarity, Χ availability, Λ signals, Ω gradients) from interpretation.
      - Instantiate TB: define if/when review checkpoints apply in recurrent interactions.
      - If publicness/records exist: specify safeguards to prevent exposure dynamics and ensure correction-ready, structure-only documentation.

  uniform_report:
    title: "Praxeological analysis of a practice pattern: Consent under asymmetry as configuration-validity gate"
    one_paragraph_overview: |
      This reading treats consent as a property a situation must be able to carry, not as a single word or a claim about inner states.
      Under asymmetry (Ω), consent talk remains meaningful only if the frame (□) is explicit about boundaries and stopping, non-events like hesitation or withdrawal (Λ) are structurally tolerable, temporality (Θ) is treated as real, and stop-capability (Χ) is practically available.
      Drift risk increases when Ω is denied or used as steering, when stopping is priced or punished, when Λ becomes leverage, or when binding/meaning demands (Ψ) enter covertly under a “non-binding” story.
      The analysis is structure-only and is not legal, clinical, or prescriptive guidance.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Consent under asymmetry is configuration-valid only with explicit □, regulable Ω, Θ realism, Λ tolerance, and operative Χ (with Σ reachable and Ψ leak excluded)."
      - "IA risk rises when the scene is opaque about Ω gradients, when stopping is verbally asserted but practically priced, and when Λ signals trigger pressure rather than tolerance."
      - "Responsibility (M) is leverage-dependent: higher where pace/access and framing channels are controlled; ceilings apply where alternatives are constrained and Χ is non-operative."
      - "Drift preparation markers include covert Ψ demands under non-binding frames, Ω-as-steering, Λ-as-steering, Χ loss, and Θ exit fictions."
      - "Safe transmission requires structure-only language and avoidance of tribunal dynamics; the D module remains OFF while dignity is protected structurally."
    maturity_summary: |
      In terms of maturity in practice, the pattern supports adult enactment when actors treat consent as configuration-validity and keep stopping and clarification structurally safe (Χ), rather than relying on utterance proof under denied Ω.
    ia_box_summary: |
      Structurally, IA risk increases when transparency about Ω and Χ is low, justification of asymmetry cannot be assessed, time-bounds for recurrent scenes are absent, and reversibility is compromised by priced stopping.
    dignity_summary: ""
    trajectory_summary: |
      Over time, the case can move from adjustable frame and operative stopping (t0) to urgency-driven ambiguity (t1) and then to stabilized scripts with Θ hardening and priced Χ (t2) if safeguards are absent.
    open_questions_summary: |
      Key open questions are the concrete norm frame, who controls pace/access and whether Χ is practically available, which Ω gradients are present, whether Σ integration is reachable, and whether publicness/records steepen Ω and harden Θ.
    conclusion: |
      Use this case to prevent consent talk from becoming a masking label under asymmetry: make frames explicit, keep stopping practically available, tolerate hesitation/withdrawal, regulate asymmetry rather than deny it, and treat temporality as real.
      Avoid any transmission that turns the model into permission logic, proof, or person-level labeling.
