        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can represent framed allocation (□), patterned reproduction (Α), asymmetry gradients (Ω),
          temporal lock-in (Θ), non-events as structured absence (Λ), and the availability/pricing of distance (Χ),
          plus integration (Σ) and binding persistence (Ψ). But PMS core alone does not explicitly formalize the
          common drift pattern where “injustice” talk collapses into culprit-hunting or moral prosecution as a
          forced-closure device under exposure (Φ/Ω capture), nor the terminal-regime fact that a structurally
          reproduced asymmetry can remain legible even when no single actor controls the production conditions.
          The CONFLICT overlay supplies reduced signatures + drift classes that keep the regime readable (and finite)
          without converting it into person-level blame, diagnosis, or enforcement authority.

    context: >
      A stable allocation regime (institutional, organizational, infrastructural, or cultural) repeatedly produces
      unequal exposure, capacity, and outcome distribution across role-positions. Harms and disadvantages persist
      across time even when many local interactions appear “reasonable” within their immediate frames. The regime’s
      reproduction relies on patterned rules, defaults, gatekeeping, and missing corrective events rather than on a
      single continuous malicious intent.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Structural injustice is treated as a regime description: repeated reproduction of Ω-gradients under stable □,
        Α-patterning, Θ-path dependence, and Λ-missing corrections. The analysis does not claim moral worth, guilt, or
        virtue; it describes production conditions and predictable drift risks.
      protected_constraints:
        - "Scene-bound regime claims only; no global labels of persons or groups (reversibility)."
        - "Maintain Χ as real stop-capability: no fusion into verdict or urgency-as-proof."
        - "D (dignity-in-practice) constrains language under Ω: no shaming/ranking/humiliation; no dehumanizing compression."
        - "Do not convert the description into governance authority, sanction logic, or reputational enforcement (Φ/Ω capture risk)."
        - "Keep the unit of analysis explicit (policy/system/process), not persons."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Trait inference (who is 'bad' or 'good' based on role membership)."
        - "Intent attribution as structural explanation ('they intended it')."
        - "Clinical/psychological diagnosis or character typing."
        - "Stepwise intervention manuals or guaranteed solutions."
        - "Hiring/firing/selection/sorting based on this language."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "Years to decades (slow reproduction with punctuated decision points)."
      iteration_rhythm: "Repeated cycles of allocation, access, evaluation, and repair attempts."
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "Durable rules, defaults, and eligibility criteria (□ persistence)."
        - "Path dependence and lock-in of earlier decisions (Θ hardening)."
        - "Recurrent patterns in enforcement and interpretation (Α stabilization)."
        - "Durable records and procedural coupling (optional; increases Θ/Ω)."
        - "Chronic missing corrective events (Λ residue)."
      reversibility_window: >
        Typically narrowing: early corrections may be low-cost; later changes are expensive due to Θ-hardening,
        institutional coupling, and accumulated distributional consequences.
    roles:
      - role_label: "R₁: Affected position(s)"
        function: "Bear higher harm exposure / lower access / higher compliance costs under the regime."
        exposure_profile: "Ω(harm, dependence)↑; Χ often priced; low control over □."
        notes: "Not a person-type; a structural location within the regime."
      - role_label: "R₂: Gatekeeping / allocating position(s)"
        function: "Applies criteria, distributes access/resources, enforces defaults."
        exposure_profile: "Ω(control over □)↑; attribution exposure may be moderate-to-high depending on publicness."
        notes: "May act reasonably within local frames while still reproducing Ω."
      - role_label: "R₃: Benefiting position(s)"
        function: "Receive advantage via defaults, inherited access, or lower friction."
        exposure_profile: "Lower harm exposure; may have higher mobility/Χ availability."
        notes: "Benefit can be structural without intent; do not moralize."
      - role_label: "R₄: Institutional/observer layer (optional)"
        function: "Sets meta-frames, audit rules, record coupling, and publicity."
        exposure_profile: "Ω(narrative power)↑; can amplify Θ via durable records; raises MG risk."
        notes: "High risk of Φ-substitution into enforcement language."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Persistent differentiation becomes legible: access vs exclusion; safety vs exposure; opportunity vs friction;
      who must comply vs who can opt out; who is seen vs who is filtered out.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Closure pressure to explain and settle: “name the cause,” “assign blame,” “prove fairness,” “produce a verdict,”
      or “demand immediate rectification,” amplified by exposure (Ω) and time pressure (Θ).
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "Expected correction/review does not occur (Λ becomes load-bearing)."
      - "Expected equal access does not materialize despite formal rules (Λ signals hidden constraints)."
      - "Expected acknowledgment of disparity is absent or delayed (Λ residue accumulates)."
      - "Expected safe complaint channels fail to protect the vulnerable (Λ under Ω)."

  operator_mapping:
    operator_chain: ["Ψ", "Σ", "Χ", "Φ", "Θ", "Ω", "Α", "Λ", "□", "∇", "Δ"]
    reduced_signature: "Ω + Θ + Α + □ + Λ  (with Χ priced; Φ drift risk; Σ/Ψ under load)"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        □ holds allocation rules, eligibility criteria, defaults, and legitimacy narratives.
        “Fairness” often appears as a frame claim; the task here is to keep it structural (rule/constraint description),
        not verdict production.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Ω is central: unequal exposure, capacity, dependence, and liability. Structural injustice is legible when Ω
        persists across cycles and is reproduced by ordinary operations rather than by exceptional intent.
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ produces path dependence: early distributions compound; late corrections become expensive.
        “We can fix it later” often functions as Θ-deferral that increases irreversibility.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ marks missing corrections, missing access, missing protection, missing acknowledgment. These absences are not
        noise; they are the regime’s reproduction material and become leverage channels under Ω/Θ.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Α stabilizes reproduction patterns: repeated application of the same defaults yields predictable distributions;
        “how things work here” becomes self-reinforcing even when individuals rotate.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ can reopen production conditions (audit frames, causal stories), but under exposure it can drift into
        substitution: moral prosecution, reputational verdicts, or “policy-by-shame,” especially in public/institutional
        contexts.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ is required to keep regime analysis from collapsing into culprit-hunting. In many regimes Χ is priced:
        affected positions cannot pause/appeal safely, while gatekeeping positions can defer or proceduralize.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ attempts appear as reforms, accommodations, or redistributions, but may fail to carry jointly under Θ/Ω if the
        regime’s constraints remain. “Integration” cannot be presumed; it may increase cost without shifting production.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ binds identities, commitments, and institutional mandates over time. Colliding bindings (e.g., “efficiency”
        vs “equal access,” “risk control” vs “inclusion”) can persist without clean reconciliation, producing terminal
        remainder risks.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signature shorthand does not bypass PMS prerequisites. Treating “naming injustice” as equivalent to Σ,
      or as immediate authorization to enforce, indicates drift. Χ remains prerequisite for responsible Φ/Σ claims;
      Ψ cannot be externalized as coercive moral authority without violating the PMS validity gate.

        title: "Asymmetry lock-in (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Ω + Θ + Χ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Access to appeal, pause, exit, and repair (Χ) is unevenly priced across positions. This turns “process”
          into a power gradient and stabilizes distribution even without centralized intent.
      - signature_id: "DRIFT_exposure_capture"
        title: "Exposure capture (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Ω + Θ + Φ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          In public/institutional circulation, regime descriptions drift into reputational verdicts or coercive
          enforcement affordances; revision is punished and nuance becomes “evasion.”
      - signature_id: "DRIFT_binding_collision"
        title: "Binding collision (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Ψ + Ω + Θ + Σ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Colliding commitments persist across time (Θ) under unequal exposure (Ω). Reform attempts (Σ) can be locally
          coherent yet jointly non-viable under the same constraints, creating remainder-bearing regimes.
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "asymmetry_lock_in_drift"
        label: "Asymmetry lock-in (Χ priced asymmetrically)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Complaint/appeal/exit is costly for vulnerable positions while procedural delay is cheap for gatekeepers.
          This structurally reproduces outcomes and converts “time” into inequality.
      - drift_id: "exposure_capture_drift"
        label: "Exposure capture (Φ under Ω/Θ with scaled publicness)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          The regime becomes narratively weaponizable: structural terms are used to prosecute persons or groups,
          collapsing reversibility and producing enforcement-by-interpretation.
      - drift_id: "sigma_incompatibility_clash"
        label: "Σ-incompatibility (integration clash)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Reform packages can be internally coherent within different stakeholder frames yet jointly incompatible
          under the same resource and constraint topology, producing persistent remainder.
      - drift_id: "dignity_collapse_drift"
        label: "Dignity collapse (D-constraint failure under Ω/Θ)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Under long-run frustration and exposure, language drifts into shaming/ranking and totalizing group claims,
          replacing regime description with dehumanizing closure.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      CONFLICT keeps “structural injustice” from collapsing into a single-culprit story or a moral verdict engine.
      It marks predictable drift channels (exposure capture, dignity collapse) and clarifies terminal cases where
      Σ cannot fully reconcile colliding bindings under Θ/Ω—legibility without false promises of resolution.

  drift_classification:
    drift_present: true
    drift_label: "Closure-demand drift: regime critique → person/prosecution substitution under exposure"
    minimal_drift_signature: "Ω + Θ + Φ (+ Χ pressured) (+ Ψ as externalized moral authority)"
    observable_markers:
      - "Regime language used to label persons/groups as intrinsically bad (reversibility collapse)."
      - "Nuance/reframing (Φ) punished as evasion; urgency used as proof (Χ minimized)."
      - "Structural claims converted into reputational enforcement or institutional sanctions without mode shift declarations."
      - "Shaming/ranking and dehumanizing compression replaces scene-bound regime description (D failure)."
      - "Culprit-hunting becomes the primary closure device, displacing production-condition analysis."

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Disparities in harm exposure, dependence, and liability concentrate on affected positions; control over frames,
      timing, and documentation concentrates on gatekeeping/institutional roles. Observers can amplify Ω by converting
      claims into durable consequences.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Time compounds inequality: early advantages accumulate, delays harden trajectories, and correction becomes
      expensive. “Process time” can function as a structural weapon when Χ is asymmetrically priced.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Missing audits, missing protections, missing access pathways, and missing acknowledgment become load-bearing
      residues that stabilize the regime and fuel further closure demands.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Declare the unit of analysis (□): policies/defaults/constraints, not persons."
      - "Maintain Χ: keep a meta-position that blocks verdict fusion and urgency-as-proof."
      - "Use Φ to inspect production conditions (what frames, defaults, and non-events reproduce Ω) rather than prosecute."
      - "Treat Σ as constrained: reforms may be partial, local, and remainder-bearing under Θ/Ω."
      - "Make Ω explicit (who bears harm vs who controls frame/timing/records) to avoid pseudo-symmetry laundering."
      - "Preserve D: refuse shaming/ranking and dehumanizing compression even under high frustration."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Structural injustice talk predictably attracts moralization and group shaming as a substitute for production
      analysis, especially under publicness where reputational enforcement is available.
    structural_indicator: >
      Χ is attacked (“if you don’t condemn now, you’re complicit”); Φ becomes prosecution; Σ is demanded as instant
      purity proof; Ψ is externalized as coercive moral authority; reversibility collapses under Θ/Ω.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No claim about individual intentions, sincerity, or moral worth."
      - "No single-cause or single-culprit guarantee."
      - "No prescription, policy blueprint, or enforcement guidance."
      - "No authorization for selection/sorting or reputational punishment."
    claimed:
      - "Structural injustice is legible as persistent Ω reproduced by □ + Α + Θ with Λ-missing corrections."
      - "The regime can persist even when local actions are individually ‘reasonable’ within their frames."
      - "Χ and reversibility are required to prevent drift into person-level verdicts."
      - "Under exposure, Φ tends to drift into prosecution unless explicitly constrained."
      - "Some configurations are remainder-bearing: Σ can improve local coherence without eliminating systemic reproduction."
    misuse_warning: >
      High misuse risk when structural language is used to justify shaming, ranking, selection/sorting, or public
      prosecution. In public/institutional contexts, require explicit mode/publicness/misuse declarations—or refuse transfer.

  structural_closure: >
    Structural injustice is modeled as regime-level persistence of asymmetry: stable frames (□) and attractor
    reproduction (Α) generate enduring Ω-gradients across time (Θ), sustained by structured absences (Λ) such as
    missing correction and missing protection. Distance (Χ) is required to keep the analysis structural rather
    than prosecutorial; recontextualization (Φ) can reveal production conditions but drifts into exposure capture
    under publicness. Integration (Σ) may yield partial reforms yet remain remainder-bearing under colliding
    bindings (Ψ) and Θ-hardening. The case closes by fixing these production conditions and guardrails.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Structural injustice isn’t just one bad act by one person. It’s when a system’s rules, defaults, and missing
    corrections keep producing unequal burdens and unequal access over time. Even if many people act “normally”
    inside their local procedures, the overall pattern repeats. This case describes that pattern structurally—
    and sets guardrails so the topic doesn’t collapse into shaming, blame-hunting, or turning structural language
    into an enforcement weapon.
