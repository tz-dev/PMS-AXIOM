        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can represent expectation, non-event (Λ), and pattern stabilization (Α),
          but the LOGIC overlay is needed to formalize warrant-gaps, non-closure discipline,
          and drift risks (e.g., Σ-totalization) that arise when inductive success is
          misread as justificatory authority.

  scene_packet:
    scene_id: "LGC-IND-01"
    context: >
      An agent, institution, or model forms expectations about future regularities from
      past observations (science, forecasting, everyday reasoning). The scene concerns
      the transition from observed repetition to projected stability, and the pressure
      to treat projection as justified closure.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Inductive inference inside an explicitly declared epistemic/practical frame:
        what counts as relevant data (Δ), what prediction horizon is intended (Θ),
        and what level of certainty is claimed (□).
      protected_constraints:
        - "No deductive guarantee is assumed to be available for future regularity."
        - "Non-closure (Λ) is carried as a structural boundary, not eliminated."
        - "Integration (Σ) remains provisional coordination, not final authority."
        - "Reversibility: inductive commitments must remain revisable under new data (Φ)."
        - "Distance (Χ) must prevent closure laundering and authority conversion."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Metaphysical guarantees of uniformity of nature as final closure."
        - "Any claim that induction yields certainty independent of frame (□)."
        - "Person-level competence, intelligence, or virtue assessment."
        - "Normative prescriptions about what one 'ought' to believe."

    temporality:
      time_scale: "From short-run repetition to long-run regularity claims."
      iteration_rhythm: "Iterative: observe → project → test/update → reframe (as needed)."
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "Institutional routines of measurement and replication."
        - "Model update cycles and forecasting feedback loops."
        - "Social reinforcement of successful predictions (stabilizing Α)."
      reversibility_window: >
        Revision is possible whenever the operative frame (□) remains open to updating
        and recontextualization (Φ); irreversibility increases when Σ is institutionalized
        as authoritative closure.

    roles:
      - role_label: "R1_observer_integrator"
        function: "Collects observations, marks differences (Δ), and integrates patterns (Σ)."
        exposure_profile: "Exposure to being wrong increases with projection horizon (Θ) and public commitment (Ω)."
        notes: "May be a scientist, forecaster, decision-maker, or system designer."
      - role_label: "R2_audience_or_downstream_user"
        function: "Consumes inductive outputs as orientation for action or belief."
        exposure_profile: "May bear costs of projection errors under asymmetry (Ω)."
        notes: "Includes institutions, publics, dependent stakeholders."
      - role_label: "R3_frame_setter"
        function: "Defines the operative frame (□): admissible evidence, standards, and acceptable uncertainty."
        exposure_profile: "High leverage over what counts as 'justified' (Ω gradient)."
        notes: "Can be a discipline, institution, or governance layer."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Observed regularities vs deviations: repeated outcomes, correlations, stable sequences,
      and anomalies that break the pattern.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Pressure to treat repetition as reliable orientation: the drive to predict, plan,
      explain, and stabilize expectations beyond the observed window.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "No decisive warrant appears that converts repetition into necessity."
      - "No final closure event occurs that licenses certainty about unobserved cases."
      - "The hoped-for 'ultimate justification' remains absent even under successful practice."

  operator_mapping:
    operator_chain: ["Σ", "Χ", "Φ", "Θ", "Ω", "Α", "Λ", "□", "∇", "Δ"]
    reduced_signature: "PRE_MORAL_justification + LOGIC_boundary_management"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        The inductive move is frame-bound: what counts as evidence, which variables are in-scope,
        and what horizon is projected must be declared as □.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Inductive claims often carry authority gradients (expert vs lay, institution vs individual);
        errors distribute unevenly, and acceptance can be coerced via status or infrastructure.
      theta_temporality: >
        Induction is projection over time: Θ structures the leap from observed past to unobserved future.
      lambda_residue: >
        The warrant gap persists: Λ names the absence of a closure event that would justify necessity.
        This residue is not a failure to be patched by metaphysics, but a structural boundary.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Repeated success stabilizes practice as an attractor (Α): routines of inference become habitual,
        often mistaken for justification rather than operational stability.
      recontext_phi: >
        New data, anomalies, or shifts in measurement conditions induce Φ: recontextualization of the
        pattern and potentially the frame itself.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ coordinates observations into a coherent model or expectation; under LOGIC discipline,
        Σ must remain provisional and bounded by □ and Χ.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ is optional here: it appears when an agent or institution self-binds to a methodology,
        standard, or publicly accountable stance (e.g., “we revise when evidence shifts”).
      distance_chi: >
        Χ is the stop-capability that blocks the conversion of inductive success into authority or certainty.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      LOGIC reduced signatures that mention Χ or Σ are shorthand: PMS prerequisites still apply.
      Χ depends on Φ/Θ/□, and Σ depends on Χ/Φ. Any presentation of “Σ without Χ” is structurally invalid
      as a PMS application and indicates drift risk.

        formula: "Δ ∘ ∇ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Induction begins as praxis-viable orientation: differences (Δ) under a frame (□)
          and repeated non-closure (Λ) stabilize patterns (Α) without introducing norms.
      - signature_id: "LOGIC_boundary_management"
        title: "Logical boundary management (reduced signature)"
        formula: "□ ∘ Λ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Logic orders and integrates inductive expectations while carrying non-closure (Λ).
          Χ prevents Σ from becoming dogmatic closure or epistemic domination.
      - signature_id: "NON_CLOSURE_stability"
        title: "Sustainable non-closure (boundary attractor) (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Δ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          The scene stabilizes around a held boundary: practice proceeds with usable patterns
          while the ultimate warrant remains absent.
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "dogmatism_sigma_totalization"
        label: "Dogmatism (Σ-totalization)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Repeated inductive success (Α) and integration (Σ) invite the closure drive to treat
          coherence as certainty and to deny Λ, especially under institutional incentives.
      - drift_id: "technocratic_reduction_frame_overconstraint"
        label: "Technocratic reduction (□-overconstraint)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Frames can harden into “the model is the world,” excluding unmodeled remainder and
          treating blind spots as non-existence; this is common where measurement and control dominate.
      - drift_id: "authority_capture_omega_inflation"
        label: "Authority capture (Ω-inflation)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Expertise gradients can be converted into justificatory authority (“because we can predict,
          we are right”), suppressing Χ and foreclosing revision.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      The LOGIC overlay makes explicit (i) the warrant-gap as a non-closure boundary (Λ) to be carried,
      (ii) the structural temptation to convert Σ into final authority, and (iii) drift classes that
      distinguish disciplined induction from closure laundering and authority capture.

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Downstream users may bear the costs of inductive error more than the integrator, especially when
      inductive outputs are institutionalized and hard to contest (Ω gradients).
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Over time, successful induction can be embedded into infrastructure (standards, models, policy),
      making revision costly; lock-in grows when Σ is treated as closure rather than provisional coordination.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      The persistent absence of ultimate warrant remains: uncertainty cannot be eliminated without substitution.
      Attempts to erase this residue increase brittleness and drift risk.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Declare the operative frame (□): evidence scope, horizon (Θ), and claim-strength."
      - "Treat Λ (warrant gap) as a carried boundary, not a defect to be patched by certainty claims."
      - "Use Χ to prevent closure laundering (successful prediction ≠ ultimate justification)."
      - "Allow Φ-driven revision: update models and frames when conditions shift."
      - "Keep Σ provisional: integration as coordination under explicit uncertainty budgets."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Inductive outputs acquire coercive authority (Ω inflation), pressuring compliance or silencing dissent,
      especially in institutional settings.
    structural_indicator: >
      Suppression of Χ and denial of Λ: inductive integration (Σ) is treated as final truth, and frame choices (□)
      become opaque or non-negotiable.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "A deductive solution to induction (no final justification is produced)."
      - "A metaphysical guarantee of uniformity of nature."
      - "Any moral or prescriptive 'ought' about belief or action."
      - "Any evaluation of persons, competence, or virtue."
    claimed:
      - "Induction is structurally a pattern-stabilization practice under persistent warrant non-closure (Λ)."
      - "LOGIC discipline consists in carrying Λ within □ while using Χ to prevent Σ-totalization."
      - "Drift risks are structurally identifiable (dogmatism, frame overconstraint, authority capture)."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use this case to convert predictive success into epistemic or moral authority, or to deny revision rights.
      Do not treat non-closure (Λ) as a defect warranting coercive certainty.

  structural_closure: >
    The problem of induction is specified as a structural configuration in which repeated success stabilizes patterns (Α)
    and integrated expectations (Σ) over time (Θ), while an ultimate warrant remains absent (Λ). PMS–LOGIC closes the case
    by producing a bounded taxonomy of inductive regimes and an anti-drift discipline: carry Λ within □, apply Χ against
    Σ-totalization, and keep revision (Φ) available.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Induction works in practice because repeated experience can stabilize usable expectations. But nothing happens that
    turns “it worked so far” into a guaranteed truth about all future cases. PMS–LOGIC treats that missing guarantee as a
    structural limit to be carried, not something to cover up with certainty. The point is to keep reasoning disciplined:
    be explicit about the frame, stay revisable, and avoid turning a coherent model into unquestionable authority.
