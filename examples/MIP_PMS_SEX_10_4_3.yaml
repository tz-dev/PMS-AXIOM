  snapshot:
    short_case_description: |
      A sexual interaction (single or repeated) is narrated as “unclear” or “mixed signals,” with boundaries shifting in-the-moment or retroactively.
      The risk pattern is that □ (frame) does not stabilize what counts as stop/renegotiate, Λ non-events (missing clarification/repair) become structurally active, and Χ (stop-capability) is nominal but practically weakened under Ω/Θ.
      The analysis tracks how scripted ambiguity (Α) can harden over time and how covert meaning/binding stakes (Ψ leak) can enter despite unresolved □ ambiguity.

      - "R1_pace_setter_escalation_controller"
      - "R2_higher_exposure_boundary_signal_carrier"
      - "R3_audience_optional"
    guiding_question: |
      Under which structural conditions does “boundary confusion” remain revisable coordination noise, and under which conditions does it function as a drift corridor—i.e., □ ambiguity produces Λ density, stabilizes as Α under Ω/Θ, prices Χ, keeps Σ low, and allows Ψ leak?

  role_mapping:
    object_of_observation:
      type: "practice_pattern"
      label: "Boundary confusion as frame instability (ambiguous □ → Λ density under Ω/Θ with Χ weak, Σ low)"
      description: |
        A structural pattern where boundary semantics are unstable (□ ambiguity / retroactive rewriting), making clarification/repair events fail to occur (Λ density), stabilizing scripted ambiguity (Α).
        Under asymmetry and temporality (Ω/Θ), this narrows alternatives when stopping/clarifying (Χ) is priced and integration/coordination (Σ) remains weak, increasing Ψ leak risk (covert meaning/obligation binding).

      - role_label: "R1_pace_setter_escalation_controller"
        function: "Controls escalation steps, timing, and interpretation of signals; can make □ explicit and keep Χ operative."

    analyst_role:
      description: "Template-level structural analyst; not adjudicating legal guilt/intent; not prescribing behavior."
      power_position_reflection: |
        In a high-stakes domain, analyst language can become tribunal logic or permission logic. This reading stays structure-only, role-bound, correction-ready, and avoids person-level attribution. Misuse (shaming/exposure/absolution logic) is treated as an IA/D artifact risk.
    publicity_degree: "variable (parameterized)"

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: |
      - Protected constraint: no person evaluation, no intent attribution, no moral ranking; no legal/forensic determinations.
      - Boundaries are treated as configuration carriers (□/Λ/Χ/Σ), not as moral virtues or “good person” traits.
      - D0 is untouchable; D module remains OFF; dignity is protected structurally via anti-shaming and scene-bound language.
      - IA-box is a structural check (T/J/TB/R), not a verdict about persons.
    variable_elements: |
      - Embedding: one-off vs repeated episodes; relationship vs institutional role context.
      - Boundary semantics: what counts as “stop,” “pause,” “renegotiate,” escalation thresholds, and renewal requirements.
      - Channel control: who sets pace, who interprets signals, who can pause/exit without penalty (Χ pricing).
      - Publicness/records coupling: private vs documented vs public narration/media amplification.
      - Σ pathways: whether integration/repair windows exist and are safe to invoke; whether TB review checkpoints are present in repeated contexts.
    unfair_high_M_zones: |
      - Where R2 alternatives are constrained and stopping/clarifying (Χ/Λ) is priced or punished, high individual M for “not stopping sooner” is structurally unfair (ceiling applies).
      - Where □ is systematically ambiguous and renegotiation is socially unsafe, assigning sole responsibility to the higher-exposure role ignores structural co-causes (system axiom).
      - Where publicness/records amplify Θ and raise reputational stakes, simplistic blame heuristics convert structural drift into person verdicts (invalid use).
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: |
      - “We’re just bad at boundaries” used to normalize stable □ ambiguity and avoid explicit rules.
      - “Mixed signals happen” used to treat Λ (pause/hesitation) as illegible noise rather than validity-relevant events.
      - “It didn’t mean anything” used while Ψ-relevant meaning/obligation is later imported covertly.
      - “You could have stopped anytime” used while Χ is priced and Σ repair windows are absent.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: |
        Actors may recognize that signals feel “mixed” or “unclear,” yet fail to recognize that validity depends on stabilizing □ semantics (stop/renegotiate/escalation thresholds) and tolerating Λ events (pauses, hesitation) as neutral. Under ∇ urgency, attention narrows to momentary momentum rather than to maintaining operable Χ and reachable Σ.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: |
        Retroactive boundary rewriting; “obvious” boundaries that cannot be stated consistently; hesitation interpreted as invitation; stopping or clarifying triggers pressure or devaluation; Φ-only narrative minimization after discomfort; repetition of “confusion” as a stable script (Α).
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: |
        Confusing ambiguity with inevitability; treating Λ events as disruptive; denying Ω gradients via pseudo-symmetry; treating Θ as resettable; importing Ψ stakes (trust/commitment/identity meaning) covertly under an unstable frame.
    coherence:
      official_narratives: |
        “It was unclear.” “Mixed signals.” “We’re just bad at boundaries.” “It’s fine.” “Stop means stop (obviously).”
      visible_enactments: |
        Boundary talk is implicit or shifting; clarification is delayed or avoided; hesitation is reinterpreted; stopping is late or costly; repair is replaced by smoothing narratives; repeated episodes stabilize ambiguity (Α), narrowing alternative moves.
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: |
        Coherence breaks when narratives of “clarity” coexist with unstable □ semantics, when Λ signals trigger pressure, when Χ is nominal but priced, when Σ repair is absent, or when Ψ meaning claims arrive after earlier “non-meaning” frames.
    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: |
        - Make □ explicit enough to carry stop/renegotiate semantics and escalation thresholds.
        - Keep Χ operative: stopping/clarifying must be practically available without punishment.
        - Treat Λ as validity-relevant: pauses/hesitation/silence must be tolerable and not coercively reinterpreted.
        - Install Σ integration: after discomfort, use verification/repair rather than Φ-only smoothing.
        - Treat Θ as real: repeated ambiguity hardens costs and reduces reversibility; add TB checkpoints if episodes repeat.
        - Prevent Ψ leak: no covert meaning/obligation demands under unresolved □ ambiguity.
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: |
        Responsibility is displaced into “confusion narratives” that normalize ambiguity and avoid explicit boundary work. Alternatively, responsibility is shifted onto the higher-exposure role for not stopping/clarifying despite priced Χ. Third layers (audience/institution) may shift responsibility into optics or documentation while lived Χ/Σ remain weak.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: |
        When ambiguity stabilizes, scripts (Α) harden; Θ accumulation raises later exit costs; interpretive disputes become identity-relevant via Ψ leak. Third parties may adopt harmful heuristics (“mixed signals” as cover) or tribunal dynamics, increasing IA and public dignity risks.
    power:
      formal_power_distribution: |
        Variable: may be situational control (space/access/pacing), role authority, dependency, or social standing. Formal authority is not required for strong Ω gradients.
      factual_power_distribution: |
        Power concentrates in channel control: who sets pace, who can interpret signals credibly, who can penalize pauses, who can reframe (Φ), and who controls publicness/records. Ω steepens when exit is costly and Θ consequences accumulate.
      used_alternatives: |
        - Proceeding under ambiguity to avoid conflict when Χ is costly.
        - Avoiding explicit boundary talk if it is punished or ridiculed.
        - Using Φ reframing (“it’s fine / it’s just us”) to reduce immediate tension.
        - Falling back on stabilized scripts (Α) because they minimize negotiation load.
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: |
        - Making □ explicit beyond implied cues (clear stop semantics; escalation renewal points).
        - Protecting low-cost pause/renegotiation windows (Χ protection).
        - Minimal Σ integration steps after discomfort (verification/repair; pace adjustment).
        - Time-bounded review (TB) in repeated episodes (explicit revisit checkpoints).
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: |
        D module remains OFF. D risk is handled structurally: prevent shaming/tribunal drift and avoid any person-level dignity profiling; keep the reading reversible and scene-bound.

  ia_protection:
    transparency_measures: |
      - Define what “boundary confusion” means structurally: □ instability (stop/renegotiate/escalation semantics) rather than moral blame.
      - Map Ω gradients (pace control, interpretive authority, exposure) without moralization.
      - Specify what counts as Λ events (pauses/hesitation/silence) and prevent coercive reinterpretation.
      - Make Χ operativity testable: can stopping/clarifying occur without penalty or degradation?
      - Flag drift markers: retroactive rule changes, Λ-as-steering, Α script lock-in, Φ-only smoothing, Ψ leak under Θ.
    time_bound_measures: |
      - In repeated episodes: install TB review checkpoints to revisit □ clarity and Χ operativity after N cycles/time windows.
      - Treat repeated “confusion” without structural change (Α) as TB-trigger: require explicit re-framing rather than assumed continuity.
    reversibility_measures: |
      - Protect Χ: pause/stop/clarify/renegotiate must be practically available without punishment; preserve meta-position.
      - Require minimal Σ steps after discomfort: verification/repair/pace adjustment; avoid Φ-only narrative substitution.

    course_in_words: |
      The pattern begins as local ambiguity that could be repaired by making □ explicit and treating Λ events as neutral.
      When clarification/repair is skipped and stopping/clarifying is priced, ambiguity stabilizes as a script (Α) and Θ accumulation narrows reversibility.
      Over time, Φ-only narratives normalize confusion while Σ remains weak, increasing IA risk and Ψ leak likelihood.
    responsibility_viability_range: |
      Viability is highest when boundary work remains tied to carrier conditions: explicit □, tolerable Λ, operative Χ, speakable/regulable Ω, and reachable Σ (with TB checkpoints in repeated episodes).
      Viability collapses when ambiguity becomes default (Α), Χ is priced, Σ repair is absent, and meaning binds covertly (Ψ leak) as Θ costs accumulate.

    unclear_points: |
      - What is the concrete embedding (one-off vs repeated; relationship vs institutional), and what boundary norm frame is assumed?
      - What are the operative □ semantics: what counts as stop/pause/renegotiate; which escalation thresholds require explicit renewal?
      - What is the practical availability of Χ: can stopping/clarifying occur without penalty; what is socially priced?
      - Which Ω gradients are present (dependency, standing, access/interpretation control) and are they nameable within □?
      - Is there a Σ integration pathway (verification/repair) that is safe to invoke, and what triggers it?
      - Is there publicness/records coupling that steepens Ω and hardens Θ?
    missing_data_or_perspectives: |
      - Higher-exposure role perspective: real alternatives, perceived Χ pricing, what counts as safe boundary signal.
      - Higher-leverage role perspective: willingness to slow/clarify, accept Λ, avoid ambiguity-as-cover and Ψ leak.
      - Institutional/audience perspective (if present): incentives for optics, narrative performance, and documentation hardening.
    distortion_risks: |
      - Moralization drift (turning validity constraints into virtue/vice judgements).
      - Overfitting: treating all ambiguity as drift even where carriers are protected and repair occurs.
      - Under-weighting publicity effects on Θ and interpretive power.

  biases_case_level:
    initial_intuition: |
      Boundary confusion can function as a drift corridor: unstable □ semantics produce Λ density, normalize ambiguity as script (Α), and narrow reversibility under Ω/Θ when Χ and Σ are weak. This is treated as a hypothesis about configuration drift, not a verdict about persons or intent.

    counter_reading_outline: |
      Counter-reading: Boundary ambiguity can be a transient coordination issue in novel contexts and can remain non-harmful when □ is actively clarified, Λ events are tolerated as neutral, Χ is fully operative, and Σ repair is used promptly after discomfort.
      In such embeddings, ambiguity is not drift but learning-in-progress; IA risk arises only when ambiguity is stabilized as default under Ω/Θ with priced Χ and absent Σ.

  analyst_reflection:
    self_implication_notes: |
      This domain is high-risk for public misuse and for collapsing structure into person judgement. The analyst’s language can become tribunal logic or permission logic. Therefore the reading stays configuration-level, avoids advice scripts, keeps D module OFF, and treats dignity protection as a structural constraint on transmission.
    possible_next_steps: |
      - Add one concrete vignette and separate observed □/Ω/Λ/Χ events from drift interpretation.
      - Specify norm frame alternatives (legal/professional/cultural) or choose one explicitly for the instance.
      - If publicness/records are present: instantiate safeguards for amplification effects and correction-ready documentation.
      - Instantiate TB review cadence for repeated episodes and define Σ repair triggers.

  uniform_report:
    title: "Praxeological analysis of a practice pattern: Boundary confusion as frame instability (ambiguous □ → Λ density under Ω/Θ with Χ weak, Σ low)"
    one_paragraph_overview: |
      This reading analyses a pattern where a sexual interaction is narrated as “unclear” or “mixed signals,” while the shared boundary frame is not stable enough to specify what counts as stopping, pausing, or renegotiating.
      In the model, boundaries are not personal virtues but configuration carriers: clarity depends on explicit framing, tolerance for pauses, and practically available stopping.
      Drift risk increases when missing clarification or repair becomes structurally active, repeated ambiguity stabilizes into a script, and the costs of time and asymmetry accumulate.
      The analysis is structure-only and does not assess intent, legal culpability, or prescribe behavior.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Boundary confusion names a drift corridor where unstable framing (□) produces dense non-events (Λ) and stabilizes scripted ambiguity (Α) under asymmetry and time (Ω/Θ)."
      - "IA risk rises when stopping/clarifying (Χ) is nominal but socially priced and when integration/repair (Σ) remains weak."
      - "Narrative coherence (“mixed signals”) can remain high while configuration validity is low."
      - "Responsibility (M) is leverage-dependent: higher where pace/interpretation channels are controlled; ceilings apply where alternatives are constrained and Χ is priced."
      - "Safe transmission requires structure-only language and avoidance of tribunal or permission logic; D module remains OFF."
    maturity_summary: |
      In terms of maturity in practice, the pattern remains adult-capable only when boundary framing is made explicit, pauses are tolerable, stopping is practically available, and repair is reachable; otherwise ambiguity hardens into a drift script over time.
    ia_box_summary: |
      Structurally, asymmetry is risky when transparency about boundary semantics and stopping costs is partial, justification of Ω cannot be assessed under ambiguity, time-bounds for repeated episodes are missing, and reversibility narrows as stopping becomes priced.
    dignity_summary: ""
    trajectory_summary: |
      Over time, the case can move from adjustable ambiguity (t0) to skipped clarification with narrative smoothing (t1) and then to stabilized confusion scripts with higher exit costs and weaker reversibility (t2) if safeguards are absent.
    open_questions_summary: |
      Key open questions are the concrete embedding and norm frame, who controls pace/interpretation and what makes stopping costly, whether repair windows exist, and whether publicity or records amplify asymmetry and harden consequences.
    conclusion: |
      Use this case to prevent boundary ambiguity from functioning as a drift mechanism: stabilize boundary semantics, protect stopping and renegotiation, make asymmetry speakable and regulable, and treat time and accumulation as real.
      Avoid any transmission that turns the model into proof, permission logic, or person-level attribution.
