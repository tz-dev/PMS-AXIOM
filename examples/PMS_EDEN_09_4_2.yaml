        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can represent recognition as a □-bound expectation (Λ), as a repeated
          pattern (Α), as a consequence/exposure gradient (Ω), and as temporal
          hardening (Θ). PMS core alone, however, does not make explicit how recognition
          drifts into EDEN-typical drift corridors: (i) Λ (missing recognition) is kept
          as a standing/comparison-relevant balance sheet, (ii) □ drifts from
          praxis-relation (coordination) to value-relation (comparison/tribunal),
          (iii) Σ remains absent or is simulated while Ψ is externalized (Ψ→Other) or
          bound to appearance-management, and (iv) stabilization proceeds via
          devaluation/humiliation substitutes up to reciprocity loss.

  scene_packet:
    scene_id: "recognition_loop_micro_to_mid_scale"
    context: >
      A recurring praxis scene (team/partnership/institution) in which contributions,
      burdens, or vulnerabilities (Ω) are unevenly distributed. Recognition (as an
      explicit event within □) is expected but is absent, delayed, or devalued. Over
      time the situation stabilizes into scripts (Α) and becomes increasingly
      comparison- and standing-driven (□-drift).
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Recognition as a coordinative event: naming/marking contribution, cost, or
        protective effort within a shared □, with the function of enabling Ω/Θ-load-
        bearing coordination (Σ) and bindable commitments (Ψ), not allocating standing.
      protected_constraints:
        - "Recognition is scene-bound and role-bound (no global person labels)."
        - "Revision window: recognition can be retroactively provided; no irreversibility claims."
        - "D (dignity-in-practice): no humiliation/ranking/shaming as a substitute act."
        - "Ω is treatable as a functional gradient (not as a judgment surface)."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Truth adjudication about personal character or motives."
        - "Diagnoses, trait ascriptions, global moral evaluation."
        - "Sanction design, exclusion, public shaming."
        - "Automatic obligation derivations from recognition deficits (Ψ→Other)."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "mid_to_long (weeks to years)"
      iteration_rhythm: "recurrent cycles (daily/weekly interactions with episodic peaks)"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "memory traces / narratives of past (non-)acknowledgments"
        - "documentation (messages, evaluations) if institutional"
        - "role stabilization (Α scripts) and path dependence"
      reversibility_window: >
        Initially moderate (recognition is catch-up-able), later shrinking via Θ
        (balance-sheeting, narrative hardening) and Ω (cost/exposure load).
    roles:
      - role_label: "R1: Recognition-carrying role (contributor / carrier)"
        function: >
          Carries visible or invisible contributions, protective efforts, or burdens;
          expects recognition as a coordination signal.
        exposure_profile: "high exposure / obligation gradient (Ω↑)"
        notes: "Risk: Λ is experienced as a standing residual debt; Χ becomes costly."
      - role_label: "R2: Recognizing instance (peer / leader / partner / system)"
        function: >
          Has the capacity to set recognition explicitly (a □-event) and thereby
          support coordination and binding.
        exposure_profile: "variable; often lower immediate exposure (Ω asymmetrically priced)"
        notes: "Can replace recognition via Φ (reframe) or delay it (Λ)."
      - role_label: "R3: Audience / institution / third parties"
        function: >
          Amplifies standing logics, documents or couples recognition to metrics; can
          accelerate □-drift.
        exposure_profile: "low direct cost; high amplification potential"
        notes: "Can transform recognition into comparison/ranking."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Difference between (a) real contribution/cost/vulnerability and (b) visible/
      recognized salience within the dominant □.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Closure pressure: desire for naming, balancing, and visibility; or a defensive
      impulse to avoid recognition as a source of obligations.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "An explicit recognition event does not occur (no thanks, no marking, no protection signal)."
      - "Repair/catch-up window is not used; delay becomes normalized."
      - "Concrete coordination integration (Σ) is not consolidated (talk/Φ only)."
      - "Binding/consequence ownership (Ψ) remains diffuse or is externalized (Ψ→Other)."

  operator_mapping:
    operator_chain: ["Ψ", "Σ", "Χ", "Φ", "Θ", "Ω", "Α", "Λ", "□", "∇", "Δ"]
    reduced_signature: >
      RECOGNITION = Δ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α ∘ Ω ∘ Θ ∘ (Φ optional) ∘ Χ ∘ Σ ∘ Ψ
      (risk corridor: Λ chronic + □ drift → Σ low/simulated + Ψ misbound/externalized)
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        □ determines whether recognition runs as a coordination signal (praxis-relation)
        or as standing/ranking (value-relation). □-drift flips recognition into
        comparison language and makes Ω unspeakable or judgment-laden.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Recognition is Ω-sensitive: who carries cost/exposure, who can set recognition,
        and who bears the consequences of its absence? Recognition is often
        asymmetrically "priced".
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ turns recognition configurations into balance sheets: repeated absence
        creates trajectories (resentment, withdrawal, demand-loops).
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ (missing recognition) is not "nothing": it operates as residue, debt,
        not-being-seen, or a steering surface and can be reinterpreted as pseudo-evidence.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Α stabilizes scripts: gratitude withdrawal, taken-for-grantedness,
        performative recognition, or demand/compliance cycles.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ can be legitimate adaptation ("different expression form") but often drifts
        into narrative repair without interface change (Σ remains absent).
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ would be: concrete, coordinatable adjustment of roles/loads/interfaces that
        makes recognition functional (not mere symbolism). Without Σ, recognition
        becomes a balance marker.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ carries recognition stably only when commitments are self-bound (Ψ→Self).
        Drift form: Ψ is externalized (Ψ→Other: "you finally must...") or bound to
        appearance-management.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ is the revision window: catch up recognition, test, de-dramatize. In drift,
        Χ becomes socially/practically costly (interpreted as attack/blame assignment).
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signature is shorthand. PMS prerequisites remain valid:
      Χ presupposes Φ/Θ/□; Σ presupposes Χ/Φ; Ψ presupposes Σ/Θ/Χ.

    active_signatures:
      - signature_id: "reciprocity_loss_signature"
        title: "Reciprocity loss — reduced"
        formula: "RECIPROCITY_LOSS = Θ-erosion of Σ/Ψ-carried coordination under real Ω with chronic Λ and stabilized Α."
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Chronically missing recognition (Λ) under real Ω shifts coordination away
          from Σ/Ψ toward substitutes; under Θ, channels erode.
      - signature_id: "meta_signature_self_control_over_other_control"
        title: "Meta-signature: self-control > other-control"
        formula: "META = (Ψ ∘ Χ) applied to Ω-handling (D constraint) > Ψ→Other demands with substitutes."
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Recognition stabilizes only when self-binding/distance (Ψ∘Χ) bounds Ω-handling;
          demand-externalization is a drift marker.
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "P-Λ-DN"
        label: "Λ → Denial / Suppression (“Nothing happened”)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Missing recognition is minimized or framed as irrelevant to reduce conflict
          costs; Λ remains active as residue.
      - drift_id: "P-Ψ-EXT"
        label: "Ψ → Externalization (“You must…”)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Recognition is recoded as an obligation lever; binding is shifted onto the
          other (Ψ→Other) instead of being carried via Σ/Ψ→Self.
      - drift_id: "chapter_11_reciprocity_loss"
        label: "RECIPROCITY_LOSS"
        why_plausible_here: >
          If recognition as a coordination signal is missing, Σ-carriage declines,
          Ψ drifts, Λ becomes chronic, Α stabilizes substitutes; Θ makes this an
          erosion trajectory.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      EDEN makes recognition visible as a drift node: recognition deficit (Λ) becomes,
      under □-drift, a comparison/standing balance, making devaluation/humiliation as
      residual stabilizers plausible and reciprocity loss explainable as a temporal
      trajectory (without moralization/diagnosis).

  drift_classification:
    drift_present: true
    drift_label: "Recognition-as-balance-sheet (Λ-chronic under comparison-□)"
    minimal_drift_signature: >
      Δ + □(praxis→value-relation) + Λ chronic + Ω salient + Θ accumulation
      with Σ low/simulated and Ψ externalized/misbound; Α stabilizes scripts.
    observable_markers:
      - "Recognition is tracked as a 'standing score' or debt ledger rather than as a coordination signal."
      - "Catch-up/revision (Χ) becomes costly or is read as an attack."
      - "More narrative repair (Φ) but no interface change (Σ remains absent)."
      - "Demand/compliance cycles (Ψ→Other) or performative recognition without binding."
      - "Long-term erosion of cooperation/reciprocity under Θ."

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      R1 carries the main costs of absence (demotivation, extra work, vulnerability).
      R2 often carries low immediate costs for non-recognition but can externalize
      coordination costs long-term. R3 can amplify standing without carrying costs.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Repeated non-recognition produces balance-sheeting, narrative hardening, and
      role fixation. Later "catch-up" has weaker repair effect (residue remains).
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Λ accumulates as an open account: "not seen", "not named". These residues
      become leverage or a tribunal surface when □ drifts.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "R1 withdraws or reduces contributions (self-protection under Ω/Θ)."
      - "R2 avoids explicit recognition when it is framed as an obligation source."
      - "Both sides use Φ (reframing) to save face when Σ changes are costly."
      - "Stabilization via scripts (Α): routine, performative recognition, or demand-loops."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Recognition is substituted by standing-devaluation (devaluation/humiliation),
      or recognition deficits are used to legitimize coercion (Ψ→Other).
    structural_indicator: >
      Rising intolerance for Χ/revision; recognition becomes a weapon/ledger;
      Σ is substituted by judgment/ranking.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "That recognition is 'owed' or morally enforceable."
      - "That any person is 'bad' or motives are transparent."
      - "That non-recognition is always intentional."
    claimed:
      - "Recognition is structurally a coordinative event within □ under Ω/Θ."
      - "Chronic absence (Λ) stabilizes scripts (Α) and can promote □-drift into comparison/tribunal."
      - "Without Σ/Ψ-carriage, recognition becomes a balance marker and reciprocity erodes under Θ."
    misuse_warning: >
      High misuse risk if used as a pressure instrument, tribunal logic, or person-labeling.
      In application: Χ + reversibility + D strictly required.

  structural_closure: >
    In PMS–EDEN, recognition is not a moral bonus but a coordinative event that makes
    Ω-sensitive contributions visible and keeps Σ/Ψ load-bearing. If recognition is
    chronically absent as Λ and □ drifts into comparison/standing, substitutes (Φ/Α/Λ)
    stabilize instead of integration (Σ) and self-binding (Ψ→Self). Under Θ, an erosion
    trajectory (reciprocity loss) emerges in which recognition functions as a ledger
    or lever rather than as an interface signal.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Recognition here is not a praise problem but a coordination signal: it marks
    contributions and costs so cooperation remains stable. When recognition repeatedly
    fails to happen, the absence itself becomes active (as an open account). Then the
    topic easily flips into comparison and standing—people count who gets how much or
    “deserves” what, instead of changing something together. Without concrete
    adjustments and real self-binding, recognition becomes a dispute object, and
    reciprocity erodes over time.
