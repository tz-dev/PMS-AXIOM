        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can represent frames (□), disclosure/non-disclosure as structured expectations (Λ),
          exposure gradients (Ω), temporal lock-in (Θ), recontextualization (Φ), distance failures (Χ),
          and integration failures (Σ) with binding displacement (Ψ). PMS-CRITIQUE adds explicit
          visibility for boundary-governance in critique contexts: (i) reach/target discipline
          (micro→macro overreach), (ii) disclosure rules (privacy vs publicness) as validity constraints,
          and (iii) authority/legitimacy drift when critique practices become enforcement scripts.

  scene_packet:
    scene_id: "SP-BE-001"
    context: >
      A workplace/team setting where a conflict occurs in a private channel (DM, 1:1 meeting, or
      confidential feedback process). Later, fragments are shared in a broader group (Slack channel,
      email list, or public post) to justify a critique or force alignment.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: "Confidential feedback / internal resolution vs public accountability discourse"
      protected_constraints:
        - "confidentiality / limited-audience expectation"
        - "context integrity (what counts as evidence is scene-bound)"
        - "right to respond inside the original frame"
      out_of_frame:
        - "global person claims (character judgments)"
        - "institution-wide or public sanctions without process"
        - "treating disclosure as proof of truth (exposure ≠ validity)"
    temporality:
      time_scale: "weeks to months"
      iteration_rhythm: "episodic flare-ups after new triggers; screenshots resurfacing"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "archivable artifacts (screenshots, forwarded emails)"
        - "repetition loops (call-out → partial apology → renewed disclosure)"
        - "narrative hardening through retellings"
      reversibility_window: "shrinks rapidly once disclosure occurs; reputational repair becomes non-linear"
    roles:
      - role_label: "discloser / critic"
        function: "moves material across frames to support critique or compel response"
        exposure_profile: "lower immediate exposure after shifting to a public/tribunal frame"
        notes: "may gain leverage via audience amplification (Ω shift)"
      - role_label: "target / disclosed-about party"
        function: "bears exposure and standing-costs; often forced into reactive defense"
        exposure_profile: "high exposure; limited refusal capacity once public"
        notes: "response options become constrained by audience expectations (□ shift)"
      - role_label: "audience / bystanders"
        function: "becomes enforcement surface (likes, agreement, HR escalation, social pressure)"
        exposure_profile: "low direct exposure; high influence as legitimacy carrier"
        notes: "can unintentionally become the mechanism that replaces Σ"

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: "private/confidential frame vs public/collective frame; coordination vs tribunal logic"
    nabla_impulse: "urge to correct, warn, protect others, or force closure/alignment"
    lambda_expected_non_events:

  operator_mapping:
    operator_chain: ["Ψ", "Σ", "Χ", "Φ", "Θ", "Ω", "Α", "Λ", "□", "∇", "Δ"]
    reduced_signature: >
      BOUNDARY_EROSION = □(context-integrity weakened) + Φ(private→public recontext) + Ω(exposure gradient)
      + Θ(irreversibility/accumulation) with Χ low/punished, Σ bypassed/simulated, Ψ displaced toward
      audience-enforced obligation (Ψ→Other).
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        □ mutates from a coordination frame (“resolve within bounded process”) into a tribunal/public frame
        (“standing must be established before an audience”). This redefines what counts as relevant action:
        disclosure becomes performative evidence rather than scene-bound material for repair.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Ω shifts: the discloser gains leverage via amplification; the target bears disproportionate exposure,
        defense labor, and reputational risk. Refusal capacity becomes asymmetric once the audience is involved.
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ turns disclosure into lock-in: artifacts persist, retellings harden, and repair costs rise over time.
        Reversibility windows narrow sharply after publicization.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ becomes an active remainder: “still unresolved” becomes a justification to widen reach.
        Non-closure is carried as a running balance that invites further disclosures.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Α stabilizes a script: trigger → partial private exchange → public escalation → demand for alignment →
        brief de-escalation → recurrence. This becomes the default path for closure attempts.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ is the key pivot: content made for one frame (private negotiation) is embedded into another
        (public adjudication), changing its meaning and function.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ is suppressed or replaced by display: instead of building an interface for repair (process, boundaries,
        commitments), the system stabilizes through audience consensus or compliance rituals.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ shifts from self-binding to process (“I will handle this within constraints”) to externalized binding
        (“you must respond publicly / you must accept this framing”). Binding becomes enforcement-through-audience.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ is low or punished: pausing, checking context-integrity, or limiting reach is treated as evasion.
        Distance is replaced by urgency and closure-demand.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signature mentions Χ/Σ/Ψ as “low/bypassed/displaced”; this does not negate PMS prerequisites.
      In PMS terms, Χ presupposes Φ/Θ/□; here the claim is that the distance-function is unavailable or penalized.

      - signature_id: "CRITIQUE_DISCLOSURE_RULES_PRIVACY_PUBLICNESS"
        title: "Disclosure rules (privacy vs publicness) as validity constraint"
        formula: "Keep □-boundaries explicit; disclosure ≠ truth; widening reach requires Χ + reversibility + D."
        how_it_applies_here: >
          The scene crosses an implicit confidentiality boundary; disclosure is used as leverage rather than
          as a last-resort safety measure. The critique’s reach expands without re-establishing validity conditions.
      - signature_id: "CRITIQUE_REACH_MICRO_TO_MACRO"
        title: "Reach drift (micro → macro) via audience amplification"
        formula: "Local scene material is treated as macro evidence; Ω increases through audience-as-authority."
        how_it_applies_here: >
          A bounded interaction is re-read as a general verdict about competence/morality, enabling broader
          claims and pressure on third parties to align.
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "DRIFT_BOUNDARY_EROSION"
        label: "Boundary erosion / context-integrity loss"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Recontextualization plus audience involvement converts repair material into standing material, shrinking
          the reversibility window and making Σ-work structurally harder.
      - drift_id: "DRIFT_LEGITIMACY_WITHOUT_AUTHORITY"
        label: "Legitimacy without authority"
        why_plausible_here: >
          The audience becomes the enforcement surface; obligations are produced without a shared process or mandate.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      The CRITIQUE lens makes “reach” and “disclosure” explicit as critique-specific failure corridors:
      boundary erosion is tracked not only as □/Φ drift but as a validity problem (what may be disclosed,
      to whom, and with what authorization) and as a reach-policy question (how far claims may travel).

  drift_classification:
    drift_present: true
    drift_label: "Boundary erosion (private → public) with tribunal frame capture"
    minimal_drift_signature: >
      □coordination → □tribunal via Φ(private→public), under Ω amplification and Θ lock-in; Χ suppressed,
      Σ bypassed, Ψ externalized to audience-enforced obligation.
    observable_markers:
      - "private messages/screenshots used as public evidence"
      - "requests for containment treated as guilt/evasion (Χ punished)"
      - "repair talk replaced by alignment demands (Ψ→Other)"
      - "non-closure cited to justify further reach expansion (Λ leverage)"
      - "recurring escalation script becomes default (Α loop)"

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Target bears exposure/standing risk and response labor; discloser gains leverage through reach;
      audience holds influence with low exposure. Refusal-capability becomes asymmetric after disclosure.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Once public, repair is no longer local: the timeline becomes non-resettable (Θ lock-in) and each
      recurrence increases reputational and coordination costs.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Persistent remainder (“not resolved”, “still unclear”) becomes a running balance across episodes,
      inviting repeated escalation and keeping the system open-ended.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Re-establish □ boundaries explicitly (what stays private; what can travel; what counts as in-frame)."
      - "Restore Χ as a protected function (pause/review window before any reach expansion)."
      - "Convert one Λ remainder into one Σ interface move (process step, clarification, scoped commitment)."
      - "Shift binding from Ψ→Other (public demands) to Ψ→Self (process commitments, reversible steps)."
      - "If safety requires disclosure, make the reach minimal and purpose-bound (no tribunal expansion)."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: "Disclosure used as humiliation/standing reduction rather than as bounded safety coordination."
    structural_indicator: "Public exposure becomes the stabilizer (Α), replacing Σ-repair; Ω is exploited as leverage surface."
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No claim about anyone’s motives, traits, or inner states."
      - "No claim that disclosure is always wrong; only that boundary travel changes validity and cost geometry."
      - "No automatic prescription; mapping can remain descriptive."
    claimed:
      - "Frame travel (Φ) plus reach expansion under Ω/Θ can erode reversibility and block Σ-repair."
      - "Boundary erosion is detectable via markers (publicization, Χ punishment, Σ bypass, Ψ externalization)."
      - "Viability improves when □ boundaries and Χ windows are restored and Λ is converted into Σ-work."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not weaponize this case to demand silence, to discredit critique, or to enforce confidentiality as cover for harm.
      Equally, do not weaponize disclosure as proof of truth or as a coercive binding instrument (Ψ→Other).

  structural_closure: >
    Boundary erosion occurs when frame constraints (□) that made a scene repairable are weakened and
    scene material is recontextualized (Φ) into a public/tribunal frame. Under Ω amplification and Θ
    lock-in, reversibility windows shrink, Σ-work is bypassed, and binding shifts toward audience-enforced
    obligation (Ψ→Other). The resulting stability is purchased by exposure management and script repetition
    (Α), while Λ non-closures persist as leverage across time.

  plain_language_summary: >
    A conflict that could have been handled privately gets moved into a public space (or a larger group).
    Once that happens, the situation becomes harder to repair: people feel forced to take sides, the exposed
    person carries most of the risk, and “we still haven’t resolved this” keeps the cycle going. The core
    problem isn’t “who is right,” but that the boundaries of the conversation broke—so the process that
    could have fixed it no longer works.
