        why_this_addon: >
          No add-on is applied. PMS core is sufficient because responsibility is modeled
          as self-binding (Ψ) operating under temporality (Θ) and asymmetry (Ω), with
          frame dependence (□), recontextualization (Φ), distance (Χ) and integration
          (Σ) constraining how obligation claims are formed and revised.

    context: >
      A responsibility claim is demanded in a frame-bound setting where duty/ownership,
      repair, and accountability must be allocated under unequal exposure and capacity.
      The structural question is how responsibility is produced, stabilized, contested,
      reassigned, and sometimes hardened into binding obligations (Ψ) across time (Θ)
      under asymmetry (Ω), without turning into person-essence or moral ranking.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Responsibility is scoped as frame-bound obligation/ownership inside declared
        frames (□): legal liability, institutional duty, professional role-accountability,
        caregiving obligation, operational ownership, or technical governance/accountability.
      protected_constraints:
        - "No person-level moral evaluation or worth ranking is derived from responsibility language."
        - "Responsibility claims must declare the operative frame (□): duty type, breach conditions, admissible evidence, and repair criteria."
        - "Asymmetry (Ω) must be made explicit where relevant: who can assign/enforce, who bears exposure, who can contest."
        - "Temporality (Θ) must be explicit: horizon of obligation, lag/accumulation, handover points, and repair windows."
        - "Reversibility: responsibility assignments remain revisable under Φ (reframing) and Λ (missing information, unclear handovers)."
        - "Dignity-in-practice (D) constrains responsibility use under Ω: no humiliation, shaming, or coercive labeling as 'accountability'."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Responsibility as metaphysical guilt/sin or 'true deservingness'."
        - "Person-essence inference (e.g., 'irresponsible type') from scene-bound outcomes."
        - "Totalizing responsibility claims that override declared frames and reversibility windows."
        - "Enforcement or punitive playbooks derived from this case."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "Trajectory-structured obligations across time (Θ): commitments persist; consequences lag; repair spans horizons."
      iteration_rhythm: "Recurring allocation moments: incident → triage → handover → repair → review; repeated across cycles."
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "Role continuity and duty expectations stabilized inside the frame (□/Θ)."
        - "Documentation, audit trails, and records stabilizing attribution (□/Θ)."
        - "Repeated scripts of ownership/deflection forming attractors (Α)."
        - "Formalization into standards/policies hardening Σ into Ψ (binding)."
      reversibility_window: >
        Responsibility interpretations remain revisable while handovers, evidence and
        reframings remain contestable (Φ), while non-events/missing links persist (Λ),
        and before binding has fixed responsibility into doctrine, precedent, or
        irreversible status claims (Ψ). Where binding exists (contract/law/policy),
        revision requires explicit Σ re-integration and re-authorization within □.

        function: "Carries duty, repair burden, and accountability costs across time."
        exposure_profile: "High exposure to cost, sanctions, workload, and reputational lock-in under Ω and Θ."

        function: "Receives impacts and demands repair or accountability."
        exposure_profile: "Variable; often high when contest capacity is low or when harms accumulate under Θ."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      A divergence becomes legible (Δ): expected duty/standard vs observed outcome,
      ownership vs diffusion, promised care vs experienced gap, repair expectation vs delay.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Closure pressure (∇) to assign ownership now: enable repair, restore coordination,
      allocate costs, stabilize trust, or justify sanctions; tends to compress multi-factor
      trajectories into a single 'responsible party'.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "Expected handover does not occur (unclear ownership transition, missing delegation, absent documentation)."
      - "Expected repair/acknowledgment does not arrive (silence, delay, bureaucratic deferral)."
      - "Expected alignment of duty with authority/resources is absent (duty without capacity; authority without accountability)."

  operator_mapping:
    operator_chain: ["Δ", "∇", "□", "Λ", "Α", "Ω", "Θ", "Φ", "Χ", "Σ", "Ψ"]
    reduced_signature: "Δ ∘ ∇ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α ∘ Ω ∘ Θ ∘ Φ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ ∘ Ψ"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        Responsibility is frame-defined (□): what counts as duty, breach, evidence, repair,
        and legitimate assignment depends on legal/institutional/care/operational frames.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Ω shapes assignment and exposure gradients: some roles can impose duty while others bear
        costs. Under Ω, 'accountability' can drift into cost-dumping if Χ and D are suspended.
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ makes responsibility a trajectory claim: obligations persist, consequences lag,
        repair windows close, and burdens accumulate or transfer via handovers across time.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ persists as missing handovers, missing evidence, delayed signals, and absent repair acts.
        PMS keeps these residues explicit rather than laundering closure.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Α stabilizes responsibility scripts (default blame/ownership patterns, repeated deflection,
        habitual scapegoat roles). Over time (Θ) these can harden into expectations.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ shifts the meaning of responsibility across frames (cause→liability→capability→authority→duty),
        enabling both correction and rhetorical laundering.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ integrates multi-factor causality, distributed duty, resource alignment, and layered authority
        into a coherent responsibility map before any binding claim is made.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ binds integrated commitments into stable role-duty, policy, doctrine, or identity commitments
        inside the frame—without implying moral worth.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ prevents responsibility→blame fusion and person-essence slides; keeps assignments scene-bound,
        revisable, and dignity-constrained, especially under Ω.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      A common structural failure is Δ/∇ → Ψ collapse: immediate gap recognition and closure pressure
      harden into irreversible labeling or doctrine without specifying □, without preserving Λ
      (missing handovers/evidence), without tracking Φ (meaning shift), and without Σ under Χ.
      Valid PMS application keeps responsibility as a revisable Θ/Ω configuration.

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Responsibility often flows down Ω gradients: exposed roles carry repair, blame, or workload,
      while allocating roles retain decision power and narrative control. Contest capacity over
      assignments and resource alignment is uneven under Ω.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Responsibility becomes sticky through Θ: records, audits, contracts, and narratives create lock-in.
      Once formalized (Σ→Ψ), revision is costly; delays and missed handovers compound burdens and close
      repair windows.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      High Λ load is common: multi-factor causality, incomplete evidence, unclear handovers, and delayed
      signals sustain underdetermination even when immediate coordination demands assignment.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Declare the operative frame (□): duty type (legal/institutional/care/operational) and decision purpose (repair/coordination/prevention)."
      - "Make Ω explicit: who assigns/enforces, who bears exposure, who can contest; check for cost-dumping gradients."
      - "Make Θ explicit: horizon, lag/accumulation, handover points, repair window, and what is already locked-in."
      - "Preserve Λ explicitly (missing handovers/evidence/repair signals) instead of forcing premature closure."
      - "Track Φ when 'responsibility' changes meaning across frames (cause vs liability vs capability vs authority vs duty)."
      - "Use Σ to integrate distributed responsibility (layered duties/shared causality/resource alignment) before hardening into Ψ."
      - "Apply Χ to resist coercive blame fusion under Ω; keep reversibility live unless binding is legitimately warranted."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Responsibility-talk becomes humiliation or coercive closure under asymmetry: 'accountability'
      is used to dump costs, foreclose contest, or convert provisional assignment into irreversible
      person claims.
    structural_indicator: >
      Ψ-hardening without Χ; Λ suppressed; Φ ignored; alternative Σ integrations disallowed;
      costs externalized down Ω gradients; reversibility window treated as closed by assertion.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No moral ranking or person-level worth judgement via responsibility language."
      - "No single-cause reduction of responsibility in multi-factor trajectories."
      - "No claim that binding accountability is always legitimate or always possible."
      - "No enforcement or punitive guidance derived from this case."
    claimed:
      - "Responsibility is a structural configuration where Ψ operates under Θ and Ω within declared frames (□)."
      - "Λ residues (missing handovers, missing evidence, absent repair acts) are irreducible and must remain explicit."
      - "Φ shifts responsibility meaning across frames; Σ integrates distributed duty/capability/authority; Ψ binds commitments when warranted."
      - "Valid application is constrained by Χ + reversibility + D, especially under Ω."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use this case to weaponize 'responsibility' for shaming, scapegoating, coercion,
      or irreversible person-labeling. Outputs are structural descriptions of how responsibility
      assignments and bindings form under constraints, not verdicts about worth.

  structural_closure: >
    Responsibility is modeled as Ψ-under-Θ/Ω: Δ makes duty gaps legible; ∇ pressures immediate ownership;
    □ defines duty and admissible assignment; Λ marks missing handovers/evidence/repair acts; Α stabilizes
    responsibility scripts; Ω shapes who can impose duty and who bears costs; Θ extends obligations and
    creates lock-in; Φ shifts meaning across frames; Σ integrates distributed structures; Ψ binds the
    integrated account into commitments, roles, policies, or doctrines. Where closure exceeds frame
    warrant, Λ remains explicit and reversibility is preserved under Χ and D.

  plain_language_summary: >
    This case treats responsibility as a practical structure: who is expected to carry a duty, repair a
    problem, or own an outcome—especially when power and exposure are unequal and consequences unfold
    over time. We notice a gap, feel pressure to assign ownership quickly, and choose a context that
    defines what 'responsible' means. But handovers may be missing, evidence incomplete, and obligations
    misaligned with authority or resources. The goal is to keep responsibility claims explicit about
    scope, power, and time horizon, revisable when frames change or information arrives, and
    non-coercive—so 'accountability' does not collapse into scapegoating or irreversible labeling.
