        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core captures difference (Δ), impulse toward resolution (∇), framing (□),
          non-event persistence (Λ), and stabilization of inquiry patterns (Α), but it does
          not by itself formalize why philosophical inquiry repeatedly treats non-closure
          as a defect to be eliminated. The LOGIC overlay makes visible the closure-drive
          as a logic-level pressure toward final integration (Σ), clarifies why Λ persists
          structurally, and identifies characteristic drift paths where closure is
          substituted by authority (Ω), frame absolutization (□), or Σ-totalization.

    context: >
      Systematic philosophical inquiry (metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, philosophy

      principles, or comprehensive systems.

        Philosophy frames inquiry around what counts as an explanation or solution.
        Tightening the frame intensifies closure pressure.

        Authority gradients emerge when certain systems or methods are treated as

        Closure attempts recur historically; each generation inherits stabilized

        Non-closure persists as regress, paradox, or plurality despite repeated

      distance_chi: >
        Required to prevent coherence from becoming metaphysical or institutional authority.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Treating Σ as final resolution typically suppresses Λ and bypasses Χ,
      indicating LOGIC-level drift rather than successful closure.

      System-builders or institutions can externalize uncertainty by declaring

      - "Non-closure (Λ) is structurally persistent, not a defect."

    misuse_warning: >
      This case must not be used to dismiss philosophy as futile or to enforce
      system-authority through closure rhetoric.

  structural_closure: >
    Philosophy’s drive toward closure is re-specified as a recurring configuration
    in which integration (Σ) is pursued under frames (□) while non-closure (Λ)
    persists. PMS explains the stability of this pattern through attractors (Α)
    and temporal inheritance (Θ). PMS–LOGIC closes the analysis by treating closure
    as boundary-managed coordination rather than final resolution.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Philosophy often wants definitive answers and complete systems. Structurally,
    this comes from a strong push to resolve open questions and contradictions.
    But no matter how coherent a system becomes, some openness always remains.
    PMS–LOGIC treats this not as failure, but as a built-in limit that keeps
    philosophy alive as an ongoing practice rather than a finished doctrine.
