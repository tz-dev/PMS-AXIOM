    context: >
      A closure demand arises in responsibility contexts: an agent is expected to be accountable for actions,
      while causal accounts (biography, incentives, constraints, systems, neuro/physiology) suggest that the
      agent could not have acted otherwise in the exact same conditions. The case is treated structurally:
      it models how responsibility and action become possible under asymmetry and temporality, without
      requiring metaphysical freedom or denying causal explanation.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        The free-will problem is constrained to responsibility-relevant practice frames (□): contexts in which
        commitments, attribution, sanctions, trust, and repair operate. The frame explicitly separates
        (i) causal explanation demands from (ii) accountability/commitment demands, without forcing an
        ontological thesis about indeterminism.
      protected_constraints:
        - "No metaphysical claim required (neither libertarian freedom nor strict causal fatalism)"
        - "No person-evaluation or moral ranking"
        - "Responsibility treated as structural (R = Ψ ∘ Φ ∘ Θ ∘ Ω), not as desert metaphysics"
        - "Distance (Χ) blocks fusion into verdict or global person attribution"
        - "Reversibility applies to responsibility claims and attributions"
        - "Dignity-in-practice (D) constrains the use of sanctions and labels under asymmetry"
      out_of_frame:
        - "Proving or refuting physical determinism"
        - "Inner-experience claims about 'feeling free' as decisive evidence"
        - "Ontological accounts of 'uncaused choice' as required foundation"
        - "Global trait labels (e.g., 'not responsible as a person')"
    temporality:
      time_scale: "decision episodes nested in longer trajectories (Θ)"
      iteration_rhythm: "attribution → response → repair/update → re-commitment loops"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "path dependence of commitments and records (Σ→Ψ over Θ)"
        - "institutional memory and enforcement routines (□/Ω-supported)"
        - "learning and recontextualization cycles (Φ over Θ) that revise accountability practices"
      reversibility_window: >
        Responsibility attributions remain revisable as frames shift (Φ) and new integrations emerge (Σ),
        except where explicit commitments were legitimately self-bound (Ψ) under valid gates.
    roles:
      - role_label: "Agent (actor / addressee of accountability)"
        function: "Carrier of action commitments and repair duties under asymmetry"
        exposure_profile: "Bears consequence exposure; may face sanctions or loss of standing"
        notes: "Modelled structurally as Σ/Ψ over Θ under Ω, not as an inner chooser."
      - role_label: "Attributors (peers / institutions / affected parties)"
        function: "Assign responsibility, demand reasons, request repair, or impose constraints"
        exposure_profile: "Holds variable authority; can externalize costs via Ω gradients"
        notes: "Authority must be framed (□) and bounded by Χ + D to avoid coercive overreach."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      A divergence between two closure demands: (1) causal intelligibility of action (why it happened) and
      (2) accountability intelligibility (who must respond, repair, carry commitments).
    nabla_impulse: >
      Pressure to force a single answer: either 'free will' to justify responsibility, or 'determinism' to
      dissolve it. The impulse seeks total closure by collapsing practice questions into ontology.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "A decisive metaphysical criterion for 'could have done otherwise' fails to appear."
      - "Complete causal explanation fails to yield a practice-ready accountability rule."
      - "Repair and commitment updates are absent, replaced by verdict language."

    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        The dispute is stabilized by declaring the practice frame (□): responsibility is asked as a rule of
        attribution, repair, and commitment within a scene—not as a cosmic property.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Responsibility only becomes salient where Ω exists: uneven exposure, power, capacity, vulnerability.
        Accountability is structurally about handling Ω, not about metaphysical exemption from causality.
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ turns actions into trajectories: accountability concerns persistence, downstream effects, and
        repeated opportunities for repair, not a timeless moment of uncaused choice.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ marks the non-deliverability of ultimate closure: no final criterion resolves the ontology/practice
        slide. Even with strong causal narratives, practice closure remains partially underdetermined.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Attribution routines, sanction scripts, and justification habits can stabilize (Α) into fixed
        institutional patterns—sometimes helpful, sometimes rigid.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ allows revising responsibility regimes when contexts change: new evidence, shifted capacity,
        altered institutional roles, or changed exposure distributions.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ integrates causal accounts, constraints, and social expectations into a workable responsibility
        stance (what is demanded now, what is repairable, what is owed).
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ binds commitments across time: accountability is enacted as sustained self-binding to repair,
        constraints, and role obligations—without requiring metaphysical freedom.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ prevents verdict fusion: it blocks global person-labeling and keeps attributions scene-bound,
        revisable, and dignity-constrained under Ω.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      The classic error is a dependency shortcut: attempting to derive Ψ-level accountability directly from
      Δ/∇ or from causal narration alone. PMS requires □ and Θ (practice framing + trajectory) and treats
      responsibility as emerging structurally from Ω/Θ with Φ/Χ/Σ/Ψ, not from ontological indeterminism.

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Responsibility assignments redistribute costs: those with institutional power can externalize burden,
      impose irreversible labels, or enforce compliance; affected parties may carry unchosen exposure.
      Ω gradients therefore determine which responsibility regimes are structurally dangerous.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Attributions can harden over time into path-dependent commitments: records, reputational traces,
      institutional constraints, and self-bindings become sticky, reducing revision capacity.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Residue load persists as underdetermination between causal stories and practice demands:
      causal completeness does not yield a unique accountability rule, and responsibility practices cannot
      fully eliminate uncertainty about counterfactual alternatives.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Declare the practice frame (□) before asking for 'freedom' or 'determinism' closure."
      - "Separate causal explanation demands from accountability demands (avoid ontology slide)."
      - "Treat responsibility as Ψ-stabilized commitment under Ω/Θ, not as metaphysical desert."
      - "Use Φ to revise regimes under changed capacity/exposure, and Χ to prevent verdict fusion."
      - "Preserve Λ residues: accept that no final counterfactual criterion is structurally deliverable."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Ontology is used to launder coercion: either 'they are free, therefore deserve total blame' or
      'they are determined, therefore may be treated as objects of management.' Both slides can enable
      dignity violations under Ω.
    structural_indicator: >
      Responsibility hardening into irreversible labels (Ψ without Χ + reversibility), combined with
      asymmetric enforcement capacity (Ω) and suppressed revision (Φ blocked), producing person-level
      foreclosure rather than scene-bound accountability.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No proof or refutation of physical determinism is provided."
      - "No metaphysical definition of free will is required or delivered."
      - "No psychological account of volition is assumed."
      - "No person-level verdict of 'responsible' or 'not responsible' is issued."
    claimed:
      - "The dispute is re-specified as a practice-frame closure problem, not an ontology requirement."
      - "Accountability is modelled structurally as Ψ/Σ/Χ/Φ over Θ under Ω (responsibility without metaphysical freedom)."
      - "Λ residues remain where counterfactual or ultimate grounding closure is demanded."
      - "PMS yields boundary statements and a taxonomy of responsibility stances within declared frames."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use this case as a license for total blame, total excusal, or management-only treatment.
      It is a structural artefact for framing accountability and repair under asymmetry, not a verdict engine.

  structural_closure: >
    PMS yields a bounded reframe: "free will vs determinism" is a closure-demand collision between causal
    intelligibility and responsibility practice. Under explicit frames (□), responsibility is modelled as
    sustained self-binding (Ψ) to integrated commitments (Σ) over time (Θ) under asymmetry (Ω), with Φ/Χ
    providing revision and distance discipline. Where ultimate counterfactual closure is demanded, Λ residues
    remain. Output type: boundary statements and a taxonomy of accountability modes (not metaphysical resolution).

  plain_language_summary: >
    This case treats the free-will debate as a practical question about how accountability and repair work in
    real contexts, rather than as a demand for a metaphysical proof of undetermined choice. People act under
    constraints and causal histories, but responsibility can still be defined as sustained commitment to repair
    and to handling asymmetric impact over time. The point is to make these limits explicit and prevent the
    topic from being used to justify blame, coercion, or irreversible labeling.
