    secondary_material: ""
    assumptions_and_inferences: |
      - Pattern-level structural reading only (no concrete transcript, institution, or real-person case material provided).
      - MIPractice A/C/R/P/D are applied to enactments/roles inside a recurring coupled interaction where joint continuation is demanded.
      - IA box is treated as a structural check for problematic asymmetry: interruption/withdrawal (distance/stop-capability) becoming priced,
        non-transparent, non-time-bounded, or effectively irreversible for one side under Ω/Θ.
      - Responsibility (M) is role- and constraint-dependent; no person-level attribution is intended.
    quality_and_limits:
      coverage_estimate: "medium"
      reliability_estimate: "medium"
      known_gaps:
        - "No concrete dialogue vignette/transcript; pattern-level only."
        - "No explicit domain context (family vs workplace vs institution), thus publicity and enforcement levers remain underspecified."
        - "No explicit mapping of actual exit options, retaliation costs, or the practical pricing of Χ under Ω."
        - "No timepoint-specific evidence of what repair attempts were tried and with what constraints."
      main_bias_risks_here:
        - "frame_bias (treating non-viability as inherent rather than context-dependent)"
        - "selection_bias (using a paradigmatic description without counter-examples)"
        - "hindsight_bias (reading Θ-hardening as inevitable rather than contingent)"

  snapshot:
    short_case_description: |
      Two role positions remain coupled over time with ongoing stakes. Each position can maintain internally coherent reasons within its own
      frame, yet repeated attempts to build a shared continuation fail. Under temporality (Θ) and asymmetry (Ω), interaction scripts stabilize
      (Α), absences and delays become load-bearing (Λ), and stop-capability (Χ) can become priced or asymmetrically available. The central drift
      risk is converting structural legibility into blame, diagnosis, or enforcement.
    central_actors_and_roles:
      - "Position A"
      - "Position B"
      - "Optional: institutional embedding roles (policy/records/third parties)"
    guiding_question: |
      Under what conditions is the conflict best described as a stabilized structural incompatibility (locally coherent Σ_A and Σ_B but non-viable joint Σ),
      and under what conditions does the situation drift into problematic asymmetry (IA-risk) via priced/asymmetric Χ and Θ-hardening?

    publicity_degree: "semi_public"

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: |
      - Ongoing coupling with stakes (coordination required, repeated contact, obligation continuity).
      - Temporality (Θ): path dependence, reputational memory, and shrinking revision windows.
      - Asymmetry (Ω): uneven exposure, liability, and exit/contest costs.
      - Residue (Λ): absences, delays, and non-acknowledgments can become meaning carriers under Θ/Ω.
      - Validity gate: preserve stop-capability (Χ), reversibility, and dignity constraints (D0 untouched; no person-labels).
    variable_elements: |
      - Domain context (family/workplace/institution) and corresponding publicity and enforcement levers.
      - Whether frames (□_A / □_B) are made explicit and negotiable.
      - Whether Φ recontextualization attempts are bridge-building or drift into substitution/enforcement.
      - Whether interruption/pausing (Χ) is practically available, symmetrical, and non-punitive.
      - Whether obligations (Ψ) can be renegotiated or time-bounded; whether review windows exist.
    unfair_high_M_zones: |
      - Positions with low exit options and high exposure under Ω (retaliation or dependency).
      - Contexts where coupling is structurally mandatory (legal/contractual/organisational) and alternatives are near-zero.
      - Situations with durable records and reputational coupling that make reversal prohibitively costly under Θ.
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: |
      - "This is just structural incompatibility" used to refuse any local responsibility for repair attempts or minimum dignity constraints.
      - "We are bound by obligations" used to justify coercive settlement demands without reversibility or pause rights.
      - "They are the problem" used to convert structural legibility into person-level blame, ranking, or diagnosis.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: |
        Each position may have high local knowledge of its own constraints and values, but limited knowledge of the other’s
        cost structure, exposure profile, and the practical pricing of Χ under Ω. Institutional embedding roles may know
        rules and records but treat frame assumptions as self-evident.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: |
        Repeated non-convergence despite high-quality articulation; negotiation sliding from content to premises/frames;
        escalating closure pressure; accumulating Λ residue (non-acknowledgments, delays) functioning as leverage under Θ/Ω.
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: |
        Treating demand for settlement as proof of reasonableness; confusing local coherence with joint viability; confusing
        “pause/withdrawal” (Χ) with betrayal; ignoring asymmetric pricing of distance and contestability under Ω.
    coherence:
      official_narratives: |
        "We must resolve this." "Someone must be responsible." "A single story is needed for continuation."
      visible_enactments: |
        Recurring episodes with partial resets; repeated frame disputes (□_A vs □_B); stabilization of scripts and escalation points (Α);
        attempts at recontextualization (Φ) that may bridge or may feel like substitution/enforcement.
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: |
        Narrative coherence can remain high within each role position, while joint coherence breaks persistently because
        what is required for shared continuation is structurally incompatible or prohibitively costly.
    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: |
        - Making frames explicit and negotiable (scope of obligations, what counts as concession, what counts as harm).
        - Naming asymmetries: who bears costs of delay, withdrawal, and contest (Ω audit in-scene).
        - Protecting stop-capability: enabling pauses without punishment (Χ + reversibility).
        - Time-bounding attempts: review windows, limited trials, or staged commitments to prevent Θ-hardening.
        - Preventing conversion into person-level blame, diagnosis, or enforcement via publicity escalation.
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: |
        Responsibility can drift into blame assignment ("someone must be at fault") or into settlement-demand
        ("resolution is required") rather than shared stewardship of boundaries, pause rights, and asymmetry transparency.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: |
        Short-term coordination may be maintained via pressure or compliance, but long-term costs accrue through Θ-hardening,
        accumulating Λ residue, and deteriorating dignity-in-practice when structural description is converted into person labels.
    power:
      formal_power_distribution: |
        Depends on domain. In institutional contexts, formal levers (rules, records, roles) can enforce continuation or punishment.
        In private contexts, dependency structures can function as informal enforcement.
      factual_power_distribution: |
        Ability to delay, withdraw, reframe, or demand settlement can become a power gradient. Control over narrative/publicness
        can amplify leverage; pricing of Χ (pause/exit) can be asymmetrical under Ω/Θ.
      used_alternatives: |
        - Settlement demands to restore a single narrative
        - Frame moves (□) that redefine relevance and obligation
        - Delay/non-acknowledgment (Λ) as leverage under Θ/Ω
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: |
        - Protected pause protocols (Χ) with explicit non-punitive rules
        - Explicit asymmetry mapping and contestability protections (Ω transparency)
        - Time-bounded trials and review cycles (TB) to prevent Θ-hardening
        - Clear separation of structural description from governance/enforcement mode
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: |
        D module remains OFF. Dignity risks are handled structurally: main risk is converting structural legibility into
        person-level compression, shaming, or coercive exposure under Ω/Θ, especially when Χ becomes contested or punished.

  ia_protection:
    transparency_measures: |
      - Make frames explicit (□): what counts as obligation, concession, harm, and what is out of frame.
      - Make χ explicit: define what pausing/withdrawing means, and prohibit punishing it as betrayal.
      - Name Ω: map exposure, liability, and exit/contest costs for each role position.
    time_bound_measures: |
      - Introduce time-bounded experiments (TB): limited trials, review checkpoints, and explicit criteria for continuation.
      - Prevent Θ-hardening via scheduled review windows rather than crisis-driven tipping points.
    reversibility_measures: |
      - Maintain usable pause/exit pathways with low retaliation cost (R).
      - Avoid durable-record escalation (publicness/record coupling) when it would collapse reversibility.
    participation_of_affected:
      level: "consulted"
      examples: "Treat each position as a formal input into Ω mapping and χ pricing; use structured feedback at TB review points."

  trajectory:
    key_timepoints:
      - label: "t0"
        short_description: "Early coupling: frames still negotiable; χ availability can be defined; reversibility is relatively high."
        A_band_at_t: "A ≈ 5–7/10"
        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 3–7/10 (higher for roles shaping coupling conditions)"
      - label: "t1"
        short_description: "Recurrent episodes: scripts stabilize (Α); Λ residue accumulates; pressure for settlement increases."
        A_band_at_t: "A ≈ 4–6/10"
        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 4–8/10 (rises for roles pricing χ or escalating publicness)"
      - label: "t2"
        short_description: "Θ-hardening: exit and revision become costly; χ becomes contested/priced; IA-risk rises if transparency/review/reversibility collapse."
        A_band_at_t: "A ≈ 3–6/10 (zigzag possible if TB/R exist)"
        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 4–9/10 (highest where enforcement/records/embedding were designed and maintained)"
    course_in_words: |
      The pattern often moves from disagreement within negotiable frames into stabilized cycles where joint continuation remains non-viable.
      Over time, absences and delays become load-bearing, and settlement pressure grows; if χ becomes punished or asymmetrically accessible,
      escalation and dignity risk increase. Where explicit frame-work, time-bounded review, and protected pause/exit exist, the trajectory can
      remain legible without coercive closure.
    responsibility_viability_range: |
      Viability increases when frames, χ protocols, and review windows are explicit and reversible; it collapses when settlement demand replaces
      contestability, χ is priced asymmetrically, and public/record coupling hardens Θ avoiding revision.

  open_questions_and_blind_spots:
    unclear_points: |
      - Which domain is intended (family, workplace, institutional governance, public discourse)?
      - How exactly is χ priced: what are the real costs of pausing/withdrawing for each role under Ω?
      - Are there any formal review windows, staged commitments, or reversal mechanisms, or is Θ-hardening unmanaged?
    missing_data_or_perspectives: |
      - Concrete vignette/transcript showing how settlement demands and frame disputes are enacted.
      - Mapping of durable records/publicness and how they affect reversibility and reputational costs.
      - Evidence of attempted Φ bridges and how they were received (bridge vs substitution/enforcement).
    distortion_risks: |
      - Overgeneralizing non-viability and underweighting domain-specific repair possibilities.
      - Treating “incompatibility” as an excuse for avoiding minimum dignity constraints.
      - Underestimating tragedy clause: some collisions of goods remain even under high maturity.

  biases_case_level:
    initial_intuition: |
      Structural incompatibility is often misread as moral or psychological failure because closure pressure demands a single narrative
      and a responsible party. This intuition must be checked against domain context and the real distribution of exit and contest costs.
    named_bias_risks:
      - "confirmation_bias"
      - "hindsight_bias"
      - "status_quo_bias"
      - "halo_effect"
    counter_reading_outline: |
      Counter-reading: the repeated failure to integrate may be contingent on missing process design rather than true incompatibility.
      With explicit frame negotiation, protected pauses, and time-bounded trials, a workable joint continuation might emerge. The decisive
      variable is whether χ can be preserved symmetrically under Ω and whether Θ-hardening can be managed through review windows.

  analyst_reflection:
    self_implication_notes: |
      Labelling a situation as “incompatible” can become a rhetorical weapon to end dialogue or justify exclusion. This file therefore treats
      incompatibility as a provisional structural reading and foregrounds reversibility, χ protections, and the refusal of person-level labels.
    possible_next_steps: |
      - Add a concrete vignette and map who controlled frames, records, and χ pricing at each timepoint.
      - Specify domain and publicity level; re-check IA box T/J/TB/R with real protocols and costs.
      - Provide 1–2 counter-examples where structured χ and TB review restored viability.

    title: "Praxeological analysis of a practice pattern: Conflict as structural incompatibility under coupling"
    one_paragraph_overview: |
      This reading describes a structural pattern in which two role positions remain coupled over time with ongoing stakes, while a shared continuation repeatedly fails.
      Each side can be coherent within its own frame, yet the two coherence spines cannot be integrated without prohibitive costs. Over time, commitments and records can harden,
      absences and delays can carry increasing meaning, and the ability to pause or step back can become unevenly available. The main risk is turning this legibility into blame,
      diagnosis, or coercive settlement demands. The main protections are explicit framing, protected pause and exit pathways, time-bounded review windows, and language discipline that
      avoids person-level compression.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Local coherence can persist on both sides while joint continuation remains structurally non-viable under ongoing coupling."
      - "As time hardens trajectories and costs, pauses and exits can become priced or punished, increasing asymmetry risk."
      - "Missing acknowledgments and delayed responses can become load-bearing and function as leverage when contestability is weak."
      - "The most important safeguard is to keep descriptions reversible and scene-bound, resisting conversion into blame, diagnosis, or enforcement."
    maturity_summary: |
      In terms of maturity in practice, the pattern can contain strong local coherence while remaining mixed on shared responsibility and viable joint coordination under time and asymmetry pressure.
    ia_box_summary: |
      Structurally, asymmetry risk increases when the ability to pause, withdraw, or contest becomes non-transparent, not time-bounded, or effectively irreversible for one side.
    dignity_summary: ""
    trajectory_summary: |
      Over time, the case often develops from negotiable frames into stabilized cycles and then into hardened trajectories where revision becomes costly and settlement pressure intensifies.
    open_questions_summary: |
      Important open questions are the intended domain and publicity context, the real pricing of pause and exit options for each role, and whether review windows and reversal pathways exist in practice.
    conclusion: |
      In sum, the model suggests that the central issue is not irrationality or moral failure but a structurally stabilized non-viability of joint continuation under coupling.
      For practice design, keep frames explicit, protect pause and exit pathways, time-bound attempts to prevent hardening, and maintain language discipline so structural legibility does not become a weapon.

      **Attack Points (analysis vulnerabilities):**
      - [high (structural vulnerability / likely misread)] No concrete vignette/transcript (pattern-level only)
        - Target: case.information_basis.quality_and_limits.known_gaps
        - Type: evidence_gap
        - Note: Key mechanisms (χ pricing, enforcement, contest costs, real exit paths) remain underspecified without concrete material.
        - Suggested patch: Add at least one concrete vignette/transcript and map frames, χ moves, and Ω costs explicitly.
      - [medium (relevant uncertainty / visible leverage)] Domain and publicity context unclear
        - Target: case.role_mapping.publicity_degree
        - Type: scope_leakage
        - Note: Without a specified domain, readers may overgeneralize incompatibility markers across family, workplace, or institutional contexts.
        - Suggested patch: Add a scope statement: intended domain(s), publicity level, and out-of-scope variants.
      - [medium (relevant uncertainty / visible leverage)] Justification and time-bounding thresholds not stated
        - Target: case.scores_and_ia.IA_box
        - Type: missing_conditions
        - Note: IA-box evaluation depends on explicit criteria for justification and review windows; these remain implicit in the template reading.
        - Suggested patch: Add if/then criteria for TB/R and minimal χ protections required under coupling.
      - [low (minor noise / easy patch)] Counter-reading could be operationalized
        - Target: case.biases_case_level.counter_reading_outline
        - Type: counter_reading_missing
        - Note: A counter-reading exists but lacks concrete scenarios showing process design restoring viability.
        - Suggested patch: Add 1–2 concrete counter-examples and show how χ and TB safeguards changed outcomes.
