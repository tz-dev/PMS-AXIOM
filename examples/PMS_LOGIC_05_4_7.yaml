        why_this_addon: >
          PMS-core can model framed inquiry (□), missing closure events (Λ), practice stabilization (Α),
          temporality (Θ), and integration (Σ), but it does not by itself formalize the logic-level
          competition between truth-regimes (correspondence, coherence, pragmatist, deflationary) as
          boundary-managed non-closure. The LOGIC overlay makes visible how each “truth theory”
          functions as a frame policy for closure (□ ∘ Λ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ), and it names characteristic drift
          pressures toward Σ-totalization (dogma), □-overconstraint (method lock-in), or Ω-based
          authority substitution.

    context: >
      Epistemic and institutional discourse (science, philosophy, journalism, law, engineering, AI evaluation)
      where participants invoke “truth” while implicitly switching between regimes: (i) correspondence to the
      world, (ii) coherence within a belief system, (iii) pragmatic success in action, or (iv) deflationary /
      minimalist use (truth as a logical or expressive device). Disputes escalate when a single regime is
      demanded as universally authoritative across frames.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Truth-attribution inside an explicit or implicit justificatory regime: admissible evidence, success
        criteria, allowed inferential moves, and the kind of closure being demanded (“true as correspondence,”
        “true as coherent,” “true as workable,” “true as disquotation/deflation”).
      protected_constraints:
        - "Truth-attribution is frame-bound (□); regimes specify what counts as relevant warrant."
        - "Non-closure (Λ) regarding a single regime’s universal authority is admissible and meaningful."
        - "Integration (Σ) coordinates claims within a regime; it does not generate meta-level finality."
        - "Distance (Χ) blocks laundering success/coherence/consensus into necessity or authority."
        - "Reversibility: regime choice and truth-attribution remain revisable under recontextualization (Φ)."
        - "Plural regime-use can be structurally coherent when scope boundaries are explicit (□ + Χ)."
      out_of_frame:
        - "A metaphysical proof that exactly one truth theory is universally correct in all frames."
        - "Psychological explanations of why specific agents prefer a regime."
        - "Moral evaluation of rival camps as irrational or bad-faith."
        - "Prescriptive governance or enforcement policy for epistemic institutions."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "Minutes to decades (from conversation-level claims to long research or institutional cycles)."

        - "Metrics, benchmarks, and institutional incentives (Α + Ω + Θ)"
        - "Publication/validation pipelines and archival memory (Θ)"
      reversibility_window: >
        High when Φ-updates are permitted (scope revision, method pluralism, explicit regime choice);
        low when truth-regimes harden into doctrine, infrastructure, or enforcement policy (Ψ + Θ lock-in).
    roles:
      - role_label: "R₁: Claim-maker / theorist"
        function: "Asserts truth claims; implicitly selects or mixes a truth-regime (Σ within □)."
        exposure_profile: "High exposure to Λ when challenged across regimes or scopes."
        notes: "Not a person-type; a structural function in the scene."
      - role_label: "R₂: Evaluator / validator"
        function: "Certifies truth within a regime (peer review, editors, judges, standards bodies)."
        exposure_profile: "Can externalize Λ-costs downward under Ω by declaring closure."
        notes: "Authority varies by institution; Ω-gradients are optional but common."
      - role_label: "R₃: World-contact / measurement interface"
        function: "Operational link between claims and observations (instruments, data, testimony chains)."
        exposure_profile: "Generates Λ via finitude, noise, and model-dependence."
        notes: "Includes observational and testimonial pipelines."

        function: "Acts on truth-attributions (policy, engineering, public belief, deployment)."
        exposure_profile: "Bears Θ-costs of lock-in and the risk of regime mismatch."
        notes: "Exposure rises when reversibility windows close."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Difference between (i) truth as correspondence-to-world, (ii) truth as coherence-within-system,
      (iii) truth as pragmatic success in action, and (iv) truth as a deflationary/logical device — and the
      fact that these differ in closure demands, admissible evidence, and authority pathways.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Pressure to close disputes by selecting one regime as universally decisive (e.g., “only correspondence
      counts,” “only coherence matters,” “it works, so it’s true,” “truth is just a linguistic device, so stop
      arguing”), especially under deadlines, conflict, or institutional incentives.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "No single frame-internal criterion yields universal regime authority across domains."
      - "No decisive meta-level event settles which truth-regime is correct for all contexts without remainder."
      - "No finite success record removes regime ambiguity (workability can diverge from correspondence)."
      - "No coherence proof guarantees world-contact without additional framing assumptions."

    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        Truth theories function as frame policies: they define what counts as warrant and what kind of closure
        is being demanded (correspondence, coherence, pragmatist, deflationary).
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Regime control can become an authority gradient: certifiers decide which truth-standard applies, shifting
        exposure and error-costs to others.
      theta_temporality: >
        Regimes differ in time horizons: correspondence often demands long-run convergence; pragmatism privileges
        near-term workability; coherence evolves with system revisions; deflationary use stabilizes discourse
        without adding new tests.
      lambda_residue: >
        Meta-level remainder persists: no final event forces a single regime to dominate all frames; switching
        regimes without explicit framing produces recurrent disputes.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Disciplines stabilize habitual regime use (e.g., lab science → correspondence-weighted; mathematics →
        coherence-weighted; engineering → pragmatist-weighted; some semantics → deflationary).
      recontext_phi: >
        Boundary cases force scope shifts: what counted as decisive under one regime becomes insufficient when
        goals, domains, or stakes change.
      integration_sigma: >
        Within a regime, Σ yields workable coordination (accepted claims, models, explanations), but Σ is not a
        meta-proof of the regime itself.
      binding_psi: >
        Institutions bind to regime standards over time (methods, legal doctrines, editorial policies), producing
        stability and lock-in that can outlive their original fit.
      distance_chi: >
        χ holds restraint: it prevents coherence, success, or consensus from being laundered into necessity;
        it keeps regime choice explicit and revisable.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Treating Σ (coherent system), “works in practice,” or institutional certification as universal truth
      typically denies Λ and shortcuts Χ/Φ. Reduced signatures are shorthand and do not negate PMS prerequisites.

        title: "Logical boundary management"
        formula: "□ ∘ Λ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Coordinates truth-attribution within an explicit regime while carrying the meta-level remainder:
          regimes are scope policies, not self-justifying authorities.
      - signature_id: "NON_CLOSURE_stability"
        title: "Sustainable non-closure"
        formula: "Δ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Explains why plural truth-regimes can remain stable in practice: disciplines form attractors that
          carry Λ rather than eliminating it.
      - signature_id: "PRE_MORAL_justification"
        title: "Pre-moral level of justification"
        formula: "Δ ∘ ∇ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Marks the structural preconditions of truth-talk as a practice: closure pressure and stabilization
          arise before any moral reading; the scene is about warrant regimes, not virtue or blame.
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "dogmatism_sigma_totalization"
        label: "Dogmatism (Σ-totalization)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Closure pressure invites treating one regime’s internal coherence as final truth, denying Λ and
          refusing Φ when scope changes.
      - drift_id: "technocratic_reduction_frame_overconstraint"
        label: "Technocratic reduction (□-overconstraint)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          A method or metric is treated as exhaustive reality; alternative truth criteria are excluded by
          default rather than scoped explicitly.
      - drift_id: "authority_capture_omega_inflation"
        label: "Authority capture (Ω-inflation)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Institutional certification substitutes for boundary discipline: “true because validated/declared,”
          converting asymmetry into epistemic necessity.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      The LOGIC overlay makes explicit that “truth theories” are not mere metaphysical options but operational
      closure policies inside frames (□). It distinguishes (i) intra-regime coordination (Σ) from (ii) meta-level
      regime authority, formalizes the persistent remainder (Λ) when regimes compete, and highlights substitution
      drifts where coherence, method, or authority is mistaken for truth itself.

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Validators and regime-setters can externalize error and revision costs to claim-makers or downstream users
      by fixing the truth-regime without carrying Λ (e.g., “only this standard counts here” without scope limits).
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Regime choices harden into infrastructure (methods, standards, legal doctrines); later Φ-updates become
      expensive and politically/operationally difficult.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      The meta-level ambiguity between regimes remains active and resurfaces in boundary cases, cross-domain
      arguments, and high-stakes contexts that force regime mismatch to become visible.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Make the truth-regime/frame (□) explicit and limit claim-strength to scope."
      - "Carry Λ at the meta-level instead of forcing one universal regime closure."
      - "Use Φ to revise scope/criteria when domains or stakes change."
      - "Apply Χ to prevent coherence/success/consensus from becoming authority."
      - "Stabilize practice via Α (exemplars, methods) while preserving reversibility."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Truth-regime choice is used to humiliate, exclude, or silence (e.g., declaring others “irrational” purely
      for operating under a different scoped regime).
    structural_indicator: >
      Λ denied; Χ suppressed; Ω-based certification replaces boundary discipline; a single regime is enforced as
      person-level hierarchy rather than held as revisable practice policy.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "A final metaphysical proof that one truth theory is universally correct."
      - "A psychological account of why agents adopt specific truth theories."
      - "A prescriptive institutional enforcement program for truth-regimes."
    claimed:
      - "Truth theories function as frame policies that specify warrant and closure demands (□)."
      - "Meta-level non-closure (Λ) persists between competing regimes; it can be carried rather than eliminated."
      - "Operational coherence/success (Σ) does not confer universal authority; Χ is required to prevent substitution drifts."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use this case to enforce interpretive hierarchy (“only my regime is rational”), to weaponize regime
      choice as exclusion, or to convert institutional asymmetry (Ω) into metaphysical necessity.

  structural_closure: >
    Truth theories are re-specified as competing closure policies inside frames (□): correspondence, coherence,
    pragmatist, and deflationary regimes each stabilize practice (Α) and enable integration (Σ), but none yields
    a universal meta-level closure event. PMS explains the stability of regime use as patterned attractors under
    time (Θ) and institutional binding (Ψ), while PMS–LOGIC closes the analysis by carrying the remainder (Λ),
    keeping regime choice explicit under distance (Χ), and reserving Φ for scope change rather than forced
    universality.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Different fields and conversations use “truth” in different ways: sometimes it means matching reality,
    sometimes fitting coherently with other beliefs, sometimes working reliably in practice, and sometimes
    serving as a simple logical way of agreeing with a statement. Problems arise when one of these meanings is
    treated as the only valid one everywhere. PMS–LOGIC treats this as a structural issue: each truth theory is
    a rule for what counts as evidence and closure in a given context, and no single rule eliminates all
    ambiguity across all contexts. Keeping the chosen standard explicit prevents coherence, success, or
    authority from being mistaken for absolute truth.
