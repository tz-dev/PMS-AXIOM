        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can represent framing (□), asymmetry (Ω), temporality (Θ),
          distance (Χ), and self-binding (Ψ), but does not by itself discipline
          how consent language can be used as a substitute for these carriers.
          The PMS-SEX overlay introduces consent-specific drift markers and
          viability constraints that make visible when consent-talk functions
          as a laundering mechanism for asymmetry, loss of distance, or covert
          binding.

    context: >
      A sexual interaction or sequence of interactions in which explicit
      consent language is prominently used (affirmations, check-ins,
      disclaimers), while structural conditions for valid consent are
      weakened or absent.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Consent framed as a legitimacy token rather than as a
        configuration-validity property.

        - "Accumulation of after-effects despite local framing (Θ)."
      reversibility_window: >
        Initially moderate, shrinking as consent-talk stabilizes scripts

    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        Consent framed as a token that closes questions rather than as
        an ongoing boundary grammar.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Real exposure and control gradients persist but are masked by
        equality rhetoric.
      theta_temporality: >
        Consequences accumulate despite local framing of consent as
        momentary and final.
      lambda_residue: >
        Non-events (missed pauses, unasked questions) persist and shape
        future behavior.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Repeated consent rituals stabilize scripts that substitute for
        coordination.
      recontext_phi: >
        Reframing discomfort as misunderstanding or miscommunication
        without interface change.
      integration_sigma: >
        Integration is weak or simulated; contradictions are not
        coordinatively resolved.
      binding_psi: >
        Meaning or legitimacy binds covertly, despite claims of
        non-binding interaction.
      distance_chi: >
        Stop-capability exists nominally but is socially priced or
        discouraged.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signature is shorthand only. Canonical PMS dependencies
      remain authoritative.

      Repetition hardens scripts; later withdrawal carries higher cost.

    claimed:
      - "Consent can function as a structural substitute."
      - "Validity depends on carriers, not utterances."
      - "Drift is configuration-specific and revisable."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not convert this case into proof, permission, or exposure logic.
      Keep analysis scene-bound and dignity-constrained.

  structural_closure: >
    Consent laundering names a structural drift in which consent-talk
    substitutes for explicit framing, regulated asymmetry, real stopping,
    and temporal realism. The configuration remains legible only when
    consent is treated as a validity condition carried by operators,
    not as a token that bypasses them.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Sometimes saying “yes” is treated as if it settles everything.
    Consent laundering happens when those words are used to cover up
    unequal risk, make stopping harder, or avoid dealing with what
    happens over time. Then consent stops being a safeguard and turns
    into a shortcut that hides real problems in the situation.
