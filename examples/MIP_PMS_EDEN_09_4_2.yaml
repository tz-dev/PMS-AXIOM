    assumptions_and_inferences: |
      - Template-level reading only (no identifiable persons/institutions; no concrete vignette).
      - “Recognition” is treated descriptively as an explicit coordinative event (□-bound) that supports load-bearing coordination, not as moral praise.
      - Primary IA risk corridor: chronic Λ + □ drift into comparison/standing, where recognition becomes ledger/weapon and refusal/revision (Χ) is priced.
      - Responsibility allocation (M) is leverage-dependent: higher where actors control frames/channels/metrics; lower for contributors with low alternatives and high dependency.

  snapshot:
    short_case_description: |
      A recurring practice pattern where recognition (as a coordinative event) is expected but repeatedly absent,
      delayed, or devalued. Over time, the absence becomes structurally active (Λ), scripts stabilize (Α), and
      framing can drift toward comparison/standing. Without concrete integration (Σ) and self-bound follow-up (Ψ→Self),
      recognition turns into a ledger/lever and reciprocity erodes under Θ.

      - "R1_contributor_or_carrier"
      - "R2_recognizing_instance"
      - "R3_audience_metrics_layer"
    guiding_question: |
      How can recognition remain a coordinative □-event that is catch-up-able (Χ), scope-bounded and non-ranking,
      and translated into concrete integration (Σ) and self-bound follow-up (Ψ→Self), so chronic Λ does not drift
      into comparison/tribunal dynamics under Ω/Θ?

  role_mapping:
    object_of_observation:
      type: "practice_pattern"
      label: "Recognition (Acknowledgment) under chronic Λ and Ω/Θ"
      description: |
        A regime where recognition is structurally expected as a coordination signal, but absence/delay becomes
        normalized and accumulates. Drift risk: □ shifts from praxis-relation to value-relation (standing/tribunal),
        Σ remains weak, and Ψ externalizes demands or binds to appearance-management.

    analyst_role:
      description: "Template-level structural analyst; not adjudicating who deserves recognition or prescribing sanctions."
      power_position_reflection: |
        Analyst language can itself convert recognition deficits into moral ranking or coercive entitlement.
        This reading therefore stays role-bound, avoids person claims, and keeps remedies as design variables (Χ/Σ/Ψ hygiene).
    publicity_degree: "variable (parameterized)"

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: |
      - Recognition is treated as □-bound coordinative event (not a moral trophy).
      - Protected constraint: no humiliation/ranking/shaming as substitute recognition (D-in-practice guardrail).
      - Entry constraint: reversibility and catch-up remain in scope; no irreversible person claims from Λ.
      - Ω gradients (burden/exposure) are treated as functional coordinates, not verdict surfaces.
    variable_elements: |
      - Embedding: team vs partnership vs institutional evaluation context.
      - Publicity/metrics coupling: private gratitude vs performance systems vs public recognition.
      - Channel design: meetings, written feedback, rituals, reviews, peer recognition systems.
      - Authority: whether R2 holds formal mandate, informal influence, or platform reach.
      - Repair mechanics: whether catch-up windows (Χ), review cadence (TB), and correction propagation (R) exist.
    unfair_high_M_zones: |
      - Where R1 has low alternatives/high dependency, assigning high M for “not pushing recognition” is unfair.
      - Where R3/metrics amplify standing while hiding decision ownership, individual M is capped; institutional M rises.
      - Where recognition is structurally discouraged by workload/time pressure, blaming individuals for Λ misses system axiom.
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: |
      - “We’re too busy for recognition” used indefinitely (Θ) without designing minimal recognition events.
      - “It’s not personal” used to deny Λ residue and block catch-up (Χ).
      - “Metrics speak for themselves” used to launder comparison-□ and avoid Σ/Ψ ownership.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: |
        Actors may notice that recognition is missing, but interpret it as “normal” or as a private emotion issue,
        not as a coordination signal failure. R2 may under-estimate how Λ accumulates under Θ for R1.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: |
        Recurrent “not seen” signals; withdrawal/reduced contribution; demand-loops; increased ledger talk
        (“I always…” / “you never…”); performative recognition without change; defensiveness when catching up.
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: |
        Confusing recognition with praise/ego rather than coordination; confusing metrics with recognition;
        treating chronic Λ as nothing; treating recognition deficit as entitlement to compel (Ψ→Other).
    coherence:
      official_narratives: |
        “Recognition shouldn’t matter.” “We’re all adults.” “The work speaks for itself.”
        “If you need thanks, that’s a problem.” (or in institutions: “The process is fair.”)
      visible_enactments: |
        Recognition events are absent/delayed; catch-up attempts trigger defensiveness;
        scripts stabilize: taken-for-grantedness, performative gratitude, or periodic blowups.
        When institutions: recognition coupled to evaluation metrics and standing displays.
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: |
        Coherence breaks when “recognition is voluntary” is enacted as avoidance, while outcomes still rely on
        invisible carrying; or when “we value people” coexists with chronic non-recognition and no Σ adjustments.
    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: |
        - Make recognition a minimal, repeatable □-event (low friction) rather than an optional flourish.
        - Keep catch-up real (Χ): allow retroactive recognition without blame escalation.
        - Translate recognition into Σ: role/load/interface adjustments when Ω is persistent.
        - Keep Ψ self-bound: avoid turning recognition deficits into coercive entitlement (Ψ→Other).
        - Where metrics/publicness exist: separate recognition-as-coordination from ranking-as-standing.
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: |
        Responsibility may shift into avoidance (“don’t be needy”), diffusion (“everyone appreciates you”),
        or externalization (“you must acknowledge me”). R3 can stabilize diffusion by applauding symbols
        while no one owns follow-up.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: |
        R1 may withdraw effort, self-protect, or exit; cooperation becomes brittle.
        Third parties learn that invisibility is normal and that ledger dynamics are how coordination is negotiated.
    power:
      formal_power_distribution: |
        Variable. In many embeddings R2 has agenda-setting power (manager/partner/system role),
        while R1 carries implementation burden. R3 (institution/audience) can set meaning via metrics.
      factual_power_distribution: |
        Power concentrates where recognition channels are controlled: who speaks, who documents, who evaluates.
        Publicness/metrics steepen Ω and accelerate Θ hardening of narratives.
      used_alternatives: |
        - Delay/avoidance of recognition to avoid implied obligations.
        - Symbolic/performative recognition that substitutes for Σ.
        - Reframes that turn recognition needs into character/tone issues.
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: |
        - Explicit catch-up windows (Χ) and “repair-safe” language.
        - Lightweight Σ moves: role/load checkpointing, redistribution, interface adjustments.
        - Clear separation of recognition from evaluation/ranking in institutional contexts.
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: |
        D module remains OFF. D risk is handled structurally: avoid humiliation/ranking substitutes,
        and avoid coercive entitlement (Ψ→Other) as recognition enforcement.

  ia_protection:
    transparency_measures: |
      - Define recognition as a coordination signal (□) and separate it from standing/ranking.
      - Make role/channel control explicit: who can mark recognition, where it is documented, and how it affects expectations.
      - Name the drift corridor explicitly: chronic Λ + comparison-□ can turn recognition into ledger/weapon.
    time_bound_measures: |
      - Install review windows for recognition-related load-bearing roles (monthly/quarterly check-in).
      - Use “sunset defaults” for invisible-carrying arrangements (auto-review after N cycles).
      - Trigger review if withdrawal, ledger talk, or repeated blowups appear (Θ escalation indicator).
    reversibility_measures: |
      - Protect catch-up (Χ): allow retroactive recognition without blame escalation; use repair-safe phrasing.
      - Ensure correction propagation: if recognition is institutional (records/metrics), update downstream narratives when repair occurs.
      - Add a lightweight Σ pathway: one Λ residue → one concrete interface change (role/load/boundary/checkpoint).

        short_description: "Recognition occasionally missing; interpreted as noise; coordination still functions via goodwill."
        A_band_at_t: "A ≈ 5–7/10"
        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 2–6/10"
      - label: "t1"
        short_description: "Repeated Λ accumulates; scripts stabilize (Α); catch-up (Χ) becomes sensitive; narratives begin to harden."

        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 4–8/10 (highest where channels/metrics are controlled)"
    course_in_words: |
      The pattern often begins as tolerable omission. Over cycles, absence becomes structurally active (Λ) and stabilizes scripts (Α).
      Without explicit catch-up and integration, framing drifts toward comparison, making repair costlier and less effective.
      Under Θ, cooperation erodes and recognition turns into a dispute object rather than a coordination support.
    responsibility_viability_range: |
      Viability is highest when recognition is minimal-but-regular, catch-up-able (Χ), and translated into small Σ adjustments,
      with self-bound commitments (Ψ→Self). Viability collapses when recognition becomes a standing ledger and refusal/revision is priced.

  open_questions_and_blind_spots:
    unclear_points: |
      - What is the concrete embedding (team/partnership/institution) and who holds formal mandate?
      - What is the publicity/metrics level and how does it shape Ω and Θ hardening?
      - What recognition channels exist (spoken, written, evaluation) and who controls them?
      - What explicit catch-up windows (Χ) exist and how are they protected from blame escalation?
      - Are there concrete Σ pathways (role/load adjustments) or only symbolic recognition rituals?
    missing_data_or_perspectives: |
      - R1 perspective: alternatives, dependency, and perceived cost of raising the issue (Χ pricing).
      - R2 perspective: constraints, fear of obligation implications, openness to revision.
      - R3/institution perspective: metric coupling and responsibility ownership (Ψ).
    distortion_risks: |
      - Moralization drift (treating recognition deficit as character failure).
      - Overfitting to power abuse narratives where time pressure/tragic constraints may be primary.
      - Confusing recognition with praise rather than coordination, leading to wrong fixes.

  biases_case_level:
    initial_intuition: |
      Recognition deficits often look like “interpersonal sensitivity,” but structurally they behave like coordination failures
      that accumulate under Θ and can flip into tribunal/standing dynamics under □ drift.
    named_bias_risks:
      - "negativity_bias"
      - "halo_effect"
      - "status_quo_bias"
      - "hindsight_bias"
    counter_reading_outline: |
      Counter-reading: In many settings recognition is intentionally de-emphasized to avoid status games,
      preserve equality, or reduce performative signaling; omissions may be noise under time pressure, not drift.
      Before classifying drift: test whether (1) catch-up (Χ) is safe, (2) small Σ changes are possible,
      (3) recognition is explicitly non-ranking, and (4) obligations are not laundered via Ψ→Other.

  analyst_reflection:
    self_implication_notes: |
      This analysis itself risks laundering authority by turning “recognition” into an entitlement claim.
      Therefore it stays structural, keeps coercive derivations out of scope, and treats fixes as design variables
      (Χ protection, Σ translation, Ψ→Self discipline, metric separation).
    possible_next_steps: |
      - Add one concrete vignette and map: who carried what (Ω), what recognition event was expected (□), what did not happen (Λ),
        and what repair attempts occurred (Χ).
      - Instantiate TB/R: define review cadence and a correction propagation rule (especially if documentation/metrics exist).
      - Add a minimal Σ pathway: one recurring pain point → one concrete interface change.

    title: "Praxeological analysis of a practice pattern: Recognition (Acknowledgment) under chronic Λ and Ω/Θ"
    one_paragraph_overview: |
      This reading treats “recognition” as a coordination signal, not as a moral trophy. In many practice settings,
      recognition is expected as an explicit event that makes contributions and burdens visible so cooperation remains stable.
      When recognition repeatedly does not happen, the absence becomes structurally active and accumulates over time.
      If framing drifts toward comparison and standing, recognition turns into a ledger or leverage device rather than a support for coordination.
      The analysis therefore focuses on design variables that keep recognition non-ranking, catch-up-able, and translated into concrete adjustments.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Risk mechanism: chronic missing recognition (Λ) under real burden gradients (Ω) hardens under time (Θ) and stabilizes scripts (Α)."
      - "Drift corridor: framing (□) can flip from coordination to standing/tribunal, making catch-up (Χ) costly and integration (Σ) symbolic."
      - "IA risk rises when recognition becomes ledger/weapon and binding is externalized (Ψ→Other) rather than self-bound (Ψ→Self)."
      - "Responsibility is leverage-dependent: highest where recognition channels, agenda, or metrics are controlled; lower where alternatives are structurally constrained."
      - "Safer coordination keeps recognition minimal-but-regular, repair-safe (Χ), and linked to small, concrete Σ moves."
    maturity_summary: |
      In terms of maturity in practice, the pattern supports adult enactment when recognition is treated as a non-ranking coordination signal,
      and when actors protect repair and convert visibility into concrete, revisable adjustments.
    ia_box_summary: |
      Structurally, IA risk increases when the asymmetry is not transparent in channel/metric control, not justified by symmetric opt-out and owned follow-up,
      not time-bounded by review windows, and not practically reversible through repair-safe catch-up and correction propagation.
    dignity_summary: ""
    trajectory_summary: |
      Over time, the case often shifts from tolerable omission to stabilized scripts and ledger talk, and then to a comparison/standing drift that erodes reciprocity.
    open_questions_summary: |
      Important open questions are the concrete embedding and publicity/metrics coupling, who controls recognition channels, how repair is protected,
      and whether small, concrete integration steps exist beyond symbolic recognition.
    conclusion: |
      Use this case to prevent recognition from turning into a tribunal: define recognition as coordination (not ranking),
      protect catch-up without blame escalation, install review windows, and translate recurring visibility gaps into small, concrete interface changes.
