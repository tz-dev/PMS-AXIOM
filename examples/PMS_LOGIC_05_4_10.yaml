          PMS-core can represent impulse toward resolution (∇), inquiry frames (□),
          persistent missing termination events (Λ), and stabilization of explanatory
          routines (Α). But it does not by itself formalize the logic-level closure
          imperative that treats non-closure as a defect and converts integration (Σ)
          into final authority. The LOGIC overlay makes visible boundary-managed
          non-closure (□ ∘ Λ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ) and typical drift pressures toward Σ-totalization,
          □-absolutization, or Ω-based certification.

  scene_packet:
    scene_id: "Explanation-demand under uncertainty (everyday + institutional)"
    context: >
      Inquiry situations in which an absence of decisive closure (Λ)—uncertainty,
      underdetermination, ambiguity, regress, or incomplete evidence—triggers a
      strong drive to "explain it anyway" and to declare the matter settled.
      The configuration appears in everyday conflict talk, science-adjacent debates,
      managerial reporting, journalism cycles, legal reasoning, and AI evaluation:
      explanations are demanded quickly, and a coherent narrative is treated as
      equivalent to warranted closure.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Explanatory activity framed as requiring a terminating answer: what counts
        as "explained," which evidence is admissible, what level of coherence is
        sufficient, and what kind of closure is being demanded (final cause, decisive
        story, single model, definitive attribution) (□).
      protected_constraints:
        - "Explanation is frame-bound (□): 'explained' is defined relative to scope and standards."
        - "Non-closure (Λ) is admissible and structurally meaningful (not mere failure)."
        - "Integration (Σ) yields workable coordination, not universal finality."
        - "Distance (Χ) prevents laundering coherence or narrative elegance into authority."
        - "Reversibility: explanations remain scene-bound and revisable under Φ."
        - "Recontextualization (Φ) may legitimately change what counts as an explanation."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Clinical or personality claims about 'needing closure' as a trait."
        - "Motive-stories as decisive explanation (e.g., fear narratives) rather than structure."
        - "Moral ranking of participants or camps."
        - "Prescriptive enforcement policy (how institutions ought to compel agreement)."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "Seconds to decades (immediate uncertainty to long-term doctrine and standards)."
      iteration_rhythm: >
        Repeating cycle: ambiguity → explanation demand → narrative/model selection →
        contestation/anomaly → patching or reframing → renewed demand.
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "Incentives for fast closure (deadlines, attention cycles, accountability rituals)."
        - "Standardized reporting/justification templates (Α) that reward coherent stories."
        - "Institutional binding into procedures, metrics, or doctrine (Ψ + Θ) when present."
        - "Repeated anomalies handled by patching rather than scope revision (Α + Θ)."
      reversibility_window: >
        High when scope is explicit and Φ-updates are allowed; low once explanations
        are bound into infrastructure, reputational commitments, or policy (Ψ + Θ lock-in).
    roles:
      - role_label: "R₁: Explainer / narrator / model-builder"
        function: "Produces coherence (Σ) inside a frame (□) under closure pressure (∇)."
        exposure_profile: >
          Exposed when Λ persists (insufficient evidence, boundary cases) or when Φ
          shifts the frame and breaks the explanation's scope.
        notes: "Not a person-type; any actor can occupy this role in a scene."
      - role_label: "R₂: Closure-demander / audience / accountability node"
        function: "Demands an explanation that terminates uncertainty; treats non-closure as unacceptable."
        exposure_profile: >
          Can externalize ambiguity costs by forcing premature closure; may escalate Ω
          when positioned as judge or gatekeeper.
        notes: "Includes managers, publics, clients, reviewers, stakeholders."
      - role_label: "R₃: Evidence interface / measurement chain"
        function: "Provides partial signals (data, testimony, observation) and introduces Λ via finitude/noise."
        exposure_profile: "Carries mismatch risks when signals are overinterpreted beyond frame validity."
        notes: "Instruments, datasets, witnesses, logs, benchmarks."
      - role_label: "R₄: Gatekeeper / certifier (optional)"
        function: "Stabilizes which explanations count as acceptable; can fix frames and standards."
        exposure_profile: >
          Ω-risk: certification can substitute for boundary discipline, shifting costs to dissenters
          and downstream users under Θ.
        notes: "Editors, courts, standards bodies, platform moderators, review committees."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Difference between (i) explanation as scoped coordination and (ii) explanation as final settlement;
      and between (i) carrying remainder (Λ) and (ii) denying remainder by narrative closure.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Drive to resolve uncertainty: pressure to provide a complete story, single cause, or decisive model,
      often under time, conflict, reputational exposure, or institutional incentive.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "No terminating event appears that removes ambiguity within the frame (Λ persists)."
      - "No finite evidence set yields universal closure without importing scope assumptions (□)."
      - "No coherence achievement (Σ) guarantees truth/authority across recontextualizations (Φ)."
      - "No final attribution eliminates later anomaly or mismatch under Θ."

    reduced_signature: >
      Δ ∘ ∇ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α  +  □ ∘ Λ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ  (+ Ω ∘ Θ ∘ Ψ as embedding / lock-in)
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        The frame defines what counts as an explanation and what type of closure is demanded
        (cause, mechanism, story, model fit, attribution). Hidden □-shifts generate conflict.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Explanation demands can become an authority gradient: some roles get to demand closure,
        others bear the costs of mismatch or revision. Gatekeeping can fix frames.
      theta_temporality: >
        Time pressure accelerates closure; over time, premature explanations accrue anomalies
        and revision costs. Lock-in raises the price of Φ-updates.
      lambda_residue: >
        Non-closure persists as structured absence: missing decisive evidence, underdetermination,
        boundary cases, or model insufficiency. Treating Λ as defect invites substitution.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Recurrent explanation-templates stabilize (habits, scripts, institutional routines),
        including patching and narrative recycling that carry Λ without acknowledging it.
      recontext_phi: >
        New contexts (stakes, domains, methods) legitimately shift what "explains" means.
        Suppressing Φ forces explanations to exceed scope.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ is valuable as coordination (workable coherence), but becomes a drift risk when
        treated as final settlement or authority.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ appears when explanations become identity commitments, doctrine, or policy:
        reversibility declines and correction becomes costly.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ keeps explanation from becoming verdict: it preserves stop-capability, scope humility,
        and the distinction between coherence and authority.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signatures are shorthand only. In PMS, Σ presupposes Φ and Χ; and Χ depends on Φ, Θ, □.
      Closure narratives that suppress Χ/Φ and deny Λ are operator distortions, not legitimate Σ.

        formula: "□ ∘ Λ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          The disciplined form of explanation: coordinate coherence (Σ) within explicit scope (□),
          carry remainder (Λ), and keep Χ active so coherence does not become authority.
      - signature_id: "NON_CLOSURE_stability"

        formula: "Δ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Explains why explanation-demand cycles can stabilize: repeated non-closure (Λ) under a frame (□)
          forms attractors (Α) such as preferred narratives, heuristics, and institutional templates.

        title: "Pre-moral level of justification"
        formula: "Δ ∘ ∇ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Locates the closure drive structurally as impulse (∇) under framed inquiry, without importing
          moral evaluation or psychological diagnosis.

        label: "Dogmatism (Σ-totalization)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Closure pressure invites treating a coherent explanation as final truth, denying Λ and suppressing Φ/Χ.
      - drift_id: "technocratic_reduction_frame_overconstraint"
        label: "Technocratic reduction (□-overconstraint)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          A model/metric frame is treated as exhaustive; what lies outside is dismissed rather than carried as Λ.

        label: "Authority capture (Ω-inflation)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Certification and gatekeeping can substitute for boundary discipline: "settled because decided."
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      The LOGIC overlay makes explicit the boundary point where explanation meets non-closure:
      it distinguishes Σ as coordination from Σ as closure authority, formalizes the role of Χ in preventing
      authority laundering, and catalogs drift pathways by which explanation-demand becomes dogma,
      technocratic frame lock-in, or certification-based closure.

    minimal_drift_signature: ""
    observable_markers:

      - "If drift occurs: certification substitutes for warrant (Ω-inflation)."

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Roles with authority to demand closure (R₂/R₄) can externalize uncertainty and revision costs.
      Challengers and downstream users bear the mismatch when explanations exceed scope.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Premature closure reduces short-term uncertainty but accumulates long-run correction costs.
      Once explanations are bound into standards or identity commitments (Ψ + Θ), revision becomes expensive.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Remainder persists as anomalies, boundary cases, and underdetermination; it returns cyclically
      as "crises" that reignite closure pressure.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Make the explanatory frame (□) explicit: what counts as explained, and at what scope."

      - "Use Χ to separate coherence from authority; keep stop-capability and reversibility."
      - "Use Φ when contexts/stakes change: revise scope rather than patching immunizations."
      - "Stabilize practice via Α (shared templates) while keeping revision pathways open (no Ψ-hardening)."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Explanation-demand becomes humiliation or exclusion: uncertainty is treated as incompetence,
      and closure is enforced through authority gradients.
    structural_indicator: >
      Λ denied; Χ suppressed; dissent framed as illegitimate; gatekeeping fixes □ as reality; certification
      substitutes for boundary discipline under Ω.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "A psychological diagnosis or trait account of 'needing closure'."
      - "A moral ranking of explanation styles or camps."
      - "A prescriptive policy for institutions on how to enforce or prevent closure."
    claimed:
      - "Explanation-demand is a structural closure pressure (∇) operating within frames (□) that meet persistent remainder (Λ)."
      - "Σ provides coordination but cannot self-authorize as final closure; Χ and Φ are required to keep scope and revisability."
      - "LOGIC boundary management is carrying Λ under explicit □ while coordinating Σ without authority laundering."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use this case to pathologize individuals, to weaponize uncertainty as incompetence, or to justify
      coercive closure by authority or certification. It is a structural mapping, not a verdict.

  structural_closure: >
    Explanation / closure drive is a stable configuration where the impulse to resolve (∇) is framed (□)
    as requiring termination, yet repeatedly encounters structured non-events (Λ). PMS explains the
    persistence of this posture through attractors (Α) and temporal pressures (Θ), with asymmetry risks (Ω)
    and possible lock-in via self-binding (Ψ). PMS–LOGIC closes the analysis by distinguishing coherent
    integration (Σ) from closure authority, keeping remainder (Λ) explicit within scope (□), maintaining
    distance (Χ) as stop-capability, and reserving recontextualization (Φ) for legitimate scope revision
    rather than immunizing patches.

  plain_language_summary: >
    People and institutions often want a clean explanation that ends uncertainty. That can be useful,
    because coherent stories and models help coordinate decisions. But many situations don’t provide a
    final “last answer,” and forcing closure can turn a convenient story into an authority claim. PMS–LOGIC
    treats this as a structural boundary: you can build workable coherence while still admitting what remains
    unknown. Keeping the scope explicit and leaving room for revision prevents explanation from becoming dogma.
