    context: >
      A recurrence claim is demanded: within a bounded system, after sufficient time,
      the system returns arbitrarily close to a prior configuration (or to a prior
      pattern class). The structural dispute concerns how "same state," "close enough,"
      "bounded," and "time horizon" are produced, stabilized, contested, and sometimes
      operationalized within frames (□). PMS treats recurrence here as a frame-bound
      closure about trajectories (Θ) and attractor regimes (Α), not as an existential
      or moral verdict.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Recurrence is scoped as trajectory return / near-return inside declared frames (□):
        what counts as system boundary, state description, admissible coarse-graining,
        tolerance, and time horizon (Θ) is frame-defined (mathematical dynamics,
        statistical physics, simulation/engineering, organizational cycles, institutional
        processes, repeated coordination scripts).
      protected_constraints:
        - "No metaphysical inevitability (e.g., 'everything must repeat') is claimed."
        - "Recurrence claims must declare the frame (□), the state representation (what variables count), and the closeness criterion (tolerance / coarse-graining)."
        - "Temporality (Θ) must be explicit: horizon, recurrence window, and iteration cadence."
        - "Reversibility discipline applies: recurrence claims are revisable under recontextualization (Φ) and under Λ (missing observables, boundary leaks, regime shifts, measurement limits)."
        - "Dignity-in-practice (D) constrains any use of recurrence under asymmetry (Ω) (no coercive 'you/it will repeat' verdicts or irreversible labeling)."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Fate narratives, moralized inevitability, or teleological claims derived from recurrence language."
        - "Psychological typing or person-essence claims based on 'they always repeat.'"
        - "Totalizing recurrence claims that override declared system boundaries, tolerances, and horizons."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "Long-horizon trajectories; recurrence times may be extreme depending on state space, resolution, and constraints (Θ)."
      iteration_rhythm: "Iterated return-check cycles: observe → compare → contest closeness → revise state/tolerance → restabilize."
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "records/traces and measurement protocols that stabilize what counts as 'return' (□/Θ)"
        - "repeatable macro-patterns and scripts that function as recurrence heuristics (Α)"
        - "planning templates, doctrines, or standards that bind recurrence interpretations over time (Σ→Ψ when formalized)"
      reversibility_window: >
        Recurrence interpretations remain revisable while boundary assumptions and state
        descriptors remain contestable (Φ), while observables are incomplete or coarse (Λ),
        and while no binding policy or doctrine has fixed the recurrence claim (Ψ). Where
        binding exists (standards, policies, 'cycle doctrine'), revision requires explicit
        re-integration (Σ) and re-authorization within the frame (□).
    roles:
      - role_label: "Modeler / measurer (state specifier)"
        function: "Defines state variables, tolerance/coarse-graining, and recurrence criterion for coordination or inference inside the frame."
        exposure_profile: "Medium; exposed to counterexamples, resolution disputes, and model mismatch."
        notes: "Operates via □ selection and Θ horizon; must preserve Λ (hidden variables, boundary leaks, resolution limits)."
      - role_label: "Boundary keeper / operator (system maintainer)"
        function: "Maintains or enforces assumed closure conditions (boundedness, constraint stability, coupling control)."
        exposure_profile: "High; exposed to failure when hidden couplings, leaks, or regime shifts violate boundary assumptions."
        notes: "Carries practical costs of boundary violations; often targeted by ∇ closure pressure to 'guarantee' recurrence."
      - role_label: "Interpreter / narrator (meaning allocator)"
        function: "Translates recurrence signals into coordination, planning, or narrative claims across audiences and contexts."
        exposure_profile: "Medium; exposed to Φ-driven frame shifts (math → policy → meaning) and sloganization risks."
        notes: "Should keep tolerance and scope explicit; avoid recurrence→inevitability slides."
      - role_label: "Authority / policy-setter (binding role)"
        function: "Can formalize recurrence claims into doctrines, standards, or constraints that govern action."
        exposure_profile: "High leverage, lower direct exposure; can externalize costs down Ω gradients."
        notes: "Represents Ω gradients that can convert heuristic recurrence into Ψ bindings."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      A return-like similarity becomes legible: the current configuration resembles a prior
      one under the selected representation, or repeated macro-patterns appear despite
      micro-variation. Δ sharpens "again-ness" versus "novelty" and invites recurrence closure.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Closure pressure to treat repetition as law-like: predictability, controllability,
      reassurance ("it returns"), or blame allocation ("it always happens"). ∇ compresses
      complex trajectories into a simple recurrence slogan.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "Expected full-state observability does not exist (hidden variables, unmeasured degrees of freedom)."
      - "Expected boundary closure fails (leakage, external coupling, regime change)."
      - "Expected exact return does not occur at the chosen resolution (only partial/approximate or pattern-class recurrence appears)."

    reduced_signature: "PMS_CORE_POINCARE_RECURRENCE_Delta_Nabla_Frame_Lambda_Alpha_Omega_Theta_Phi_Chi_Sigma_Psi"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        What counts as "the same state," "close enough," and "bounded system" is frame-defined:
        variables, tolerance, coarse-graining, admissible transformations, and decision thresholds
        depend on the declared □ (math, measurement, engineering, institutional cycle, narrative use).
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Authorities can impose recurrence interpretations ("cycle doctrine") while exposed roles bear
        the costs of acting as if recurrence were law-like. Ω gradients can convert heuristic recurrence
        into enforced expectation and lock-in.
      theta_temporality: >
        Recurrence is Θ-structured: horizon length, cadence, lag, and path dependence determine whether
        return is meaningful, observable, or operational. Long horizons can make contest and revision costly.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ persists as hidden variables, boundary leaks, finite measurement resolution, regime shifts, and
        counterfactual opacity. PMS preserves Λ rather than laundering recurrence into inevitability.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Α stabilizes repeatable macro-patterns: attractor-like regimes and scripts can yield recurrence-like
        regularities even when microstates differ. Default explanations can dominate even when Λ is high.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ transports recurrence across frames and changes the claim (math property → empirical regularity
        → institutional cycle → narrative inevitability). Φ alters admissible evidence and what 'recurrence' means.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ integrates multi-level assumptions (variables, tolerance, boundaries, resolution, horizon) into a usable
        recurrence account for coordination, without implying metaphysical inevitability.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ hardens an integrated recurrence account into doctrine, policy, or standard ("cycles are inevitable"),
        which is structurally expensive and requires Χ + reversibility discipline; otherwise it becomes coercive closure.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ prevents recurrence→fate slides and coercive "always repeats" verdicts; keeps recurrence claims bounded,
        tolerance-explicit, and revisable—especially under Ω.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Common hygiene failure: jumping from Δ/∇ ("it looks like it's repeating") directly to Ψ ("it will always repeat")
      without specifying □ (state variables, tolerance, boundaries), without preserving Λ (hidden couplings, measurement limits),
      without tracking Φ (frame shift into doctrine), and without performing Σ under Χ. Valid PMS application keeps recurrence
      claims frame-bound, resolution-explicit, revisable, and dignity-constrained.

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Authorities can impose recurrence narratives ("cycles," "inevitability") while operators and affected roles bear
      the costs of acting as if recurrence were law-like (missed interventions, overfitting, complacency, coercive expectation).
      Contest capacity over boundaries and tolerances is uneven under Ω.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Recurrence claims can become sticky through records, institutional cycles, and planning templates; once operationalized
      (process doctrine, seasonal policy, "always happens" playbooks), revision is costly and slow. Long horizons amplify lock-in
      by making falsification and counterexample collection difficult.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      High in many practical scenes: hidden degrees of freedom, boundary violations, coarse-graining artifacts, and regime changes
      sustain underdetermination even when "repeat" signals are strong.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Declare the frame (□): system boundary, state variables, tolerance/coarse-graining, and decision purpose."
      - "Make Θ explicit: horizon, cadence, and what counts as 'return within time.'"
      - "Make Λ explicit (hidden variables, boundary leaks, resolution limits, regime shifts) instead of forcing inevitability."
      - "Track Φ when recurrence is transported from math/measurement into policy or narrative claims."
      - "Use Σ to integrate multi-level recurrence assumptions rather than compressing into a slogan under ∇ pressure."
      - "Apply Χ to resist recurrence-as-verdict under Ω; keep reversibility live unless Ψ is legitimately warranted."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Recurrence language becomes coercive closure: "it always repeats" is used to foreclose revision,
      justify enforcement, or impose irreversible status claims under Ω.
    structural_indicator: >
      Ψ-hardening without Χ: recurrence is treated as a binding verdict; Λ is suppressed; Φ shifts are ignored;
      alternative Σ-integrations are disallowed; costs are externalized down Ω gradients.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No metaphysical doctrine of fate, inevitability, or 'everything repeats' is provided."
      - "No guarantee that exact recurrence is practically observable at any chosen resolution is claimed."
      - "No person-level evaluation, trait inference, or moral ranking is derived from recurrence language."
      - "No enforcement guidance for institutions is provided."
    claimed:
      - "Recurrence is modeled as a frame-bound (□) trajectory claim (Θ) about return/near-return under declared constraints and tolerances."
      - "Λ residues (hidden variables, boundary leaks, measurement limits, regime shifts) are preserved as structural outputs and must remain explicit."
      - "Α stabilizes repeatable macro-patterns; Φ shifts recurrence meaning across frames; Σ integrates assumptions; Ψ explains binding into doctrines/standards when formalized."
      - "Χ + reversibility + D constrain recurrence talk under Ω."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use this case to weaponize recurrence ("it always repeats") for coercion, resignation-enforcement,
      or irreversible labeling. Outputs are structural descriptions of how recurrence closure is produced within
      frames, not verdicts about persons or destiny.

  structural_closure: >
    PMS reframes Poincaré-style recurrence as a structural closure configuration: Δ makes "return-like similarity"
    legible; ∇ pressures law-like closure; □ defines system boundary, state description, and tolerance; Λ marks hidden
    variables, boundary leaks, and resolution limits; Α stabilizes repeatable macro-patterns; Ω shapes who can impose
    recurrence doctrine and who bears costs; Θ governs horizons and lag; Φ shifts recurrence meaning across frames; Σ
    integrates multi-level assumptions; Ψ binds selected accounts into standards or doctrines. Where closure exceeds
    frame warrant, Λ remains explicit.
  plain_language_summary: >
    This case treats "recurrence" as a way of claiming that a system can come back near where it once was, but only
    within a specified description of the system, a tolerance for "close enough," and a chosen time horizon. In practice,
    we often see repeated patterns and feel pressure to treat them as laws or inevitabilities. Yet boundaries leak, variables
    stay hidden, and what counts as "the same state" depends on context and measurement. The aim is to keep recurrence claims
    explicit about scope and limits, revisable under new framing or evidence, and non-coercive—especially when power differences
    turn "cycles" into enforced doctrines.
