    assumptions_and_inferences: |
      - Pattern-level structural reading only (no concrete vignette, identifiable persons, or institution specified).
      - “Asymmetry lock-in” is treated as a regime claim: χ (pause/exit/appeal) is formally available but practically priced differently by role.
      - IA box is used as a legitimacy screen for drift into verdict theater, pseudo-symmetry laundering, or enforcement-by-language under exposure.
      - M-responsibility is treated as leverage-dependent: higher for roles controlling □/Θ/windows/records/publicness coupling; lower where Χ≈0 and dependence is structural.

      reliability_estimate: "medium"
      known_gaps:

        - "Publicness/record coupling is optional/variable; no concrete embedding specified."
        - "No concrete constraint topology: who set windows, penalties, escalation paths, and what repair channels exist is unspecified."
        - "No protected-good justification for any downstream coercion/enforcement; analysis remains non-authorizing."
      main_bias_risks_here:

  snapshot:
    short_case_description: |
      A multi-role interaction exhibits persistent asymmetry in who can pause, exit, delay, appeal, or reframe without penalty.
      χ (distance/stop-capability) is formally “available” but is priced differently across roles. Over time, Θ hardens this pricing into lock-in:
      the more exposed role cannot safely stop, while the less exposed role can defer or withdraw cheaply.

    guiding_question: |
      How can χ-pricing under Ω/Θ be made legible as a structure (not a person verdict), while preventing drift into pseudo-symmetry narratives,
      blame theater, or enforcement-by-language—especially under records/publicness coupling?

    object_of_observation:
      type: "practice_pattern"
      label: "Asymmetry lock-in as χ (distance/stop-capability) priced asymmetrically under Ω/Θ"
      description: "A regime where stopping/pausing/appealing is formally present but practically priced across roles; Θ converts differential χ-pricing into durable lock-in; Λ residues (missing correction/acknowledgment) become leverage channels; Φ can expose production conditions but risks exposure-capture drift."

    publicity_degree: "variable"

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: |
      - χ-pricing regime: pause/exit/appeal is formally present but practically priced by role.
      - Ω gradients: unequal distribution of harm exposure, penalty/liability exposure, timing control, and record power.
      - Θ hardening: repeated cycles increase irreversibility and raise the cost of interruption for the high-exposure role.
      - Λ residues: missing acknowledgments/corrections/protection events become load-bearing and function as leverage channels.
      - Α stabilization: the “who can pause” script becomes the default interaction pattern.
    variable_elements: |
      - Publicness and record coupling (private vs institutional vs media-amplified) and durability of artifacts.
      - Who sets windows/penalties/escalation paths (procedural layer vs interpersonal vs institutional design).
      - Availability/pricing of consultation/appeal protections (Χ safeguards) and retaliation norms.
      - Φ handling: premise/production inquiry vs pressure/prosecution substitution (“evasion” accusations).
      - Σ handling: local agreements/process fixes vs theater that presupposes symmetric χ.
      - Participation of affected parties in defining acceptable thresholds and repair pathways.
    unfair_high_M_zones: |
      - R1: where χ is effectively unavailable or heavily penalized, high personal M attribution is structurally unfair (ceiling_rule).
      - Any actor with near-zero alternatives under dependency and Θ hardening: individual M remains limited; leverage holders carry more co-responsibility.
      - R4: when observers have low harm exposure but high narrative reach, moralized demands can produce unfair secondary harms.
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: |
      - “Exit exists, so it’s fair” asserted without mapping χ pricing, retaliation, or dependence.
      - “No one can change it” asserted without identifying who controls □/Θ/windows/records and what mitigations are feasible.
      - “Be reasonable / follow process” used as a pressure substitute that hides Ω/Θ and blocks χ protections.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: |
        Actors often perceive the felt asymmetry (“I can’t pause without consequences”), but may not perceive the mechanism:
        how windows, penalties, and record/publicness coupling price χ and convert delay into leverage. Observers may misread χ attempts as “overreaction” or “evasion.”
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: |
        Asymmetric response windows; differential penalties for delay/exit; repeated non-acknowledgment; procedural deferral loops; pressure language (“just be reasonable”);
        punishments for consultation/appeal; durable records hardening interpretations; reframing treated as illegitimate.
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: |
        Treating formal availability as practical symmetry; treating χ attempts as moral weakness; collapsing Φ inquiry into prosecution;
        mistaking Σ settlement for structural repair; ignoring R3’s leverage in setting windows/records and coupling them to consequences.
    coherence:
      official_narratives: |
        “Anyone can take a step back.” “Just follow the process.” “If you hesitate, you escalate.” “Being calm proves reason.”
        “If you can’t pause, that’s your personal issue.” “Rules are neutral.”
      visible_enactments: |
        Cycles of pressure → attempted pause/appeal → penalty differential → renewed dependence; asymmetric timing; delayed/non-responses as leverage;
        occasional process “fixes” that do not change χ pricing; reframing attempts either enable premise inquiry or trigger pressure.
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: |
        Local coherence can look high (procedures followed) while joint coherence fails (χ is not equally usable). Coherence breaks when symmetry rhetoric
        denies differential pricing, or when “process” is used as cover for asymmetric timing and penalties.
    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: |
        - Declare the unit (□): price of χ and timing/record constraints, not person essence.
        - Preserve χ protections: allow pause/consultation/appeal without retaliation where feasible.
        - Allocate responsibility by leverage: identify who controls windows, penalties, escalation, records/publicness coupling.
        - Use Φ for premise/production inquiry: who set constraints, what alternatives exist, what repair pathways exist.
        - Prevent downstream coupling: do not use the pattern description as sanction/selection logic.
        - Keep D constraints: prohibit shaming, pseudo-symmetry laundering, and dehumanizing compression.
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: |
        Responsibility often shifts onto the high-exposure role via symmetry rhetoric (“you could pause”), while window/penalty design remains under-scrutinized.
        Conversely, responsibility can be refused via “system inevitability” claims that ignore feasible mitigations and redesign levers.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: |
        Over Θ, the high-exposure role accumulates costs and loses contestability; observers can add secondary harms via shaming/exclusion.
        Under records/publicness coupling, interpretations harden and become difficult to correct, amplifying lock-in and dignity stress.
    power:
      formal_power_distribution: |
        Template-level: varies by embedding. Procedural layers often centralize windows, eligibility, escalation paths, and documentation rules;
        high-exposure roles typically have fewer safe alternatives.
      factual_power_distribution: |
        R2/R3 may control timing levers and record coupling; R1 bears harm/penalty exposure; R4 can amplify narrative consequences with low cost.
        Publicness can scale consequences without proportional control for affected parties.
      used_alternatives: |
        - Endurance/continuation under constraint (Σ as “keep going”).
        - Attempts at appeal/consultation (Χ) that are differentially punished.
        - Recontextualization (Φ) toward premise inquiry (sometimes) or toward pressure (drift risk).
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: |
        - Protected pause/appeal without retaliation (χ protection).
        - Time-bounded review checkpoints and correction clauses.
        - Record-limitation/sunset norms where durable artifacts harden narratives.
        - Participation of affected parties in defining thresholds and repair.
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: |
        D module remains OFF. Dignity risk is handled structurally: the primary risk is secondary harm via shaming, pseudo-symmetry laundering,
        and dehumanizing compression when χ-pricing is converted into person-level verdicts.

  ia_protection:
    transparency_measures: |
      - Declare the unit (□): χ pricing and timing/record constraints, not person traits.
      - Separate observation vs evaluation: document windows, penalties, escalation paths, and dependence before moralized interpretation.
      - Name Ω gradients: distinguish harm/penalty exposure, timing control, and record/publicness power.
      - Explicitly mark inference vs case material in any concrete instance.
    time_bound_measures: |
      - Introduce time-bounded review checkpoints and correction clauses for window/penalty rules.
      - Define escalation limits: prevent indefinite pressure cycles from becoming durable governance artifacts.
      - If the pattern recurs (Α), time-bound redesign cycles for χ safeguards and repair pathways.
    reversibility_measures: |
      - Protect contestability: allow pauses/appeals without treating them as illegitimate (χ protection).
      - Prevent irreversible downstream coupling: no sanction/selection logic derived from the pattern description alone.

        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 4–8/10 (highest for actors enabling enforcement-by-language and durable record coupling)"
    course_in_words: |
      The pattern moves from initial differential χ pricing toward Θ-hardening and stabilized reproduction of “who can pause.”
      Where χ protections and contestability exist, the trajectory can stabilize as “asymmetry made legible and gradually redesigned.”
      Where records/publicness harden outputs and Φ is punished, the scene drifts into pressure scripts, pseudo-symmetry laundering, and dignity stress.
    responsibility_viability_range: |
      Viability is highest when □ is explicit, χ is protected, Φ remains premise inquiry, and review cycles are time-bounded and reversible.
      Viability collapses when symmetry rhetoric denies χ pricing, when penalties escalate for pause/appeal, and when outputs are operationalized for sanction/selection.

    distortion_risks: |
      - Overgeneralizing from the template to cases where χ pricing is actually symmetric (abstraction_bias).
      - Symmetry rhetoric masking real differential pricing (pseudo-symmetry laundering).

    initial_intuition: |
      Asymmetry lock-in names a common mechanism: “pause exists” in principle, but not at equal price, and Θ turns that difference into durable leverage.
      The main risk is misreading: either blaming the high-exposure role for not pausing, or excusing avoidable design choices as inevitability.

    counter_reading_outline: |
      Counter-reading: some scenes labeled “asymmetry lock-in” are not structurally locked in—χ protections and redesign levers exist but are unused.
      A safe application must map concrete window/penalty rules, retaliation norms, and feasible mitigations before treating χ pricing as fixed.

  analyst_reflection:
    self_implication_notes: |
      Lock-in language can become a weapon: it can shame the high-exposure role (“you should just pause”), or it can launder inevitability (“nothing could be done”).
      This reading therefore stays system-bound, preserves reversibility and χ, and requires an avoidable-lever check before treating the regime as fully stabilized.
    possible_next_steps: |
      - Add one concrete vignette and map: windows, penalties, escalation paths, Ω distributions, χ availability/pricing, Φ handling, and record coupling.
      - Specify publicness level and add matching safeguards (record limits, sunsets, correction clauses, anti-sanction coupling).
      - Add explicit if/then criteria for when pressure scripts become IA-relevant coercion (punished χ, weaponized Φ, Σ-as-compliance proof).
      - Add a short checklist distinguishing hard constraints from avoidable design choices and mitigations.

    title: "Praxeological analysis of a practice pattern: Asymmetry lock-in as χ priced asymmetrically under Ω/Θ"
    one_paragraph_overview: |
      This reading treats “asymmetry lock-in” as a structural regime where pausing, exiting, or appealing is not equally usable: it exists in principle but comes at different prices for different roles.
      Over time, repeated cycles harden the difference, so the more exposed role becomes increasingly unable to stop safely, while the less exposed role can delay or withdraw cheaply.
      The key issue is not moral character but the interaction between timing rules, penalties, dependence, and records/publicness that can turn delay into leverage.
      The analysis therefore keeps the unit structural, separates harm exposure from timing and record power, and emphasizes safeguards that protect contestability and prevent secondary harms from shaming or pressure scripts.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Asymmetry lock-in is modeled as χ (pause/exit/appeal) priced asymmetrically under Ω/Θ; formal availability is not practical symmetry."
      - "Θ hardening and Α stabilization reproduce a recurring script of “who can pause,” while Λ residues (missing acknowledgment/correction) become leverage channels."
      - "Risk rises when symmetry rhetoric denies χ pricing and when Φ inquiry is punished or converted into pressure under records/publicness."
      - "Responsibility allocation is leverage-dependent: higher for window/penalty/record controllers, lower where alternatives≈0 and χ is priced out."
      - "Misuse risk: the pattern language is operationalized for blame, shaming, or sanction/selection coupling, producing secondary harms beyond the original asymmetry."
    maturity_summary: |
      In terms of maturity in practice, the pattern supports adult enactment when it keeps the unit structural, protects contestability and pause/appeal where feasible, and sustains premise inquiry without collapsing into pressure scripts.
    ia_box_summary: |
      Structurally, IA risk rises when the asymmetry becomes non-transparent, unjustified, indefinite, or non-contestable—especially when pauses are punished and interpretations are hardened into durable records.
    dignity_summary: ""
    trajectory_summary: |
      Over time, the constellation tends to drift from early differential χ pricing toward Θ-hardening and stabilized reproduction unless pause/appeal protections and premise inquiry remain protected.
    open_questions_summary: |
      Important open questions are the concrete embedding (publicness/records), who sets windows and penalties, how χ is retaliated against, and what repair pathways exist.
    conclusion: |
      The model suggests using “asymmetry lock-in” to keep χ pricing and constraint design legible and to block pseudo-symmetry laundering and scapegoating.
      For safer practice, declare the unit, protect contestability and pause/appeal where feasible, time-bound review, and prevent downstream coupling into sanctions or selection—especially under publicness and durable records.
