        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can represent framed choice (□), time-compression (Θ), asymmetry of harm and liability (Ω),
          distance/stop-capability (Χ), and attempts at integration (Σ). But PMS core alone does not explicitly
          formalize how trolley-style dilemmas function as a CONFLICT-type closure device: a forced binary
          settlement under Θ-pressure where (i) bindings (Ψ) collide, (ii) Σ is demanded as a single verdict,
          and (iii) Χ is structurally minimized or punished ("you must choose now"). The CONFLICT overlay adds
          reduced signatures and drift classes that keep the analysis finite and prevent drift into moral ranking,
          diagnosis, or governance/enforcement laundering.

    context: >
      A decision-maker is placed in a framed scenario where any available action causes harm.
      The frame forces a binary choice (act vs refrain; divert vs not divert), often under severe
      time pressure and with salient asymmetry in who is harmed and who bears responsibility.
      The "trolley" form functions as a closure engine: it compresses moral conflict into a
      single decision point and asks for a verdict-like output.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Structural analysis of forced-choice closure: how a dilemma frame (□) compresses option space,
        elevates attribution pressure (Ω/Θ), and demands a Σ-style settlement, without claiming moral truth.
      protected_constraints:
        - "Scene-bound description only; no global person labels (reversibility)."
        - "Maintain distance (Χ) as stop-capability: the analysis may not fuse into verdict or compulsion."
        - "Dignity-in-practice (D) constrains language: no shaming, ranking, humiliation, or dehumanizing compression."
        - "Do not convert trolley outputs into governance authority or enforcement affordances (Φ/Ω capture risk)."
        - "Keep the thought experiment status explicit: it is a framing device, not an empirical model of life."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Moral verdict production (who is good/bad; who deserves harm)."
        - "Person-level diagnosis or trait inference from choices."
        - "Policy guidance, legal advice, or institutional enforcement logic."
        - "Selection/sorting decisions justified by dilemma answers (hire/fire/sanction)."
        - "Claims that the dilemma settles ethics as an ontology (metaphysical closure)."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "Seconds to minutes (compressed decision window), with potential long downstream shadow (Θ)."
      iteration_rhythm: "Often presented as single-shot, but culturally repeated as a canonical test."
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "Attribution memory: choices become narratively durable in observers/records (Θ-hardening)."
        - "Repetition as a cultural attractor (Α): the dilemma recurs as a template for argument."
        - "Institutional coupling (optional): risk frameworks, audits, or media discourse preserve outputs."
      reversibility_window: >
        Narrow in the framed moment (Θ-compression). Reversibility may reopen later via Φ
        (recontextualizing the frame), but public/record coupling can close it again.
    roles:
      - role_label: "R1: Decision-maker / switch-operator (structural role)"
        function: "Carries the forced-choice burden; asked to output a single settlement."
        exposure_profile: "High responsibility attribution exposure (Ω↑); liable to downstream Ψ-binding to the decision."
        notes: "Not a psychological subject; a role position under closure demand."
      - role_label: "R2: Directly affected parties (on-track / off-track)"
        function: "Bear harm outcomes; often represented as anonymous units inside □."
        exposure_profile: "High harm exposure; typically low control over the frame (Ω↑, Χ≈0)."
        notes: "D-risk: dehumanizing compression via counting logic."
      - role_label: "R3: Observers / evaluators (public, institution, discourse)"
        function: "Convert choices into reputational or normative judgments; can amplify exposure."
        exposure_profile: "Low immediate harm exposure but high narrative power (Ω-control over meaning)."
        notes: "Primary carrier for misuse gradient (MG) under publicness."
      - role_label: "R4: Frame-designer (optional; experimenter / institution / system designer)"
        function: "Defines the option space and what counts as available action."
        exposure_profile: "Often insulated from immediate harm; controls □ and thus closure pressure (Ω-control)."
        notes: "Key site where Φ and □ manipulation can substitute for explanation."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Difference is made legible as a binary split: action vs inaction; one set of lives vs another;
      immediate harm vs foreseen harm; direct causation vs omission.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Strong closure impulse: "choose now," "minimize harm," "be responsible," "avoid being the cause."
      The dilemma intensifies ∇ by attaching identity/standing pressure to the output.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "No option exists that avoids harm (expected 'clean' solution is absent)."
      - "No time exists for broader inquiry; deliberation is structurally blocked (Χ priced)."
      - "No post-action repair event is guaranteed that would dissolve attribution pressure (Λ residue persists)."

  operator_mapping:
    operator_chain: ["Ψ", "Σ", "Χ", "Φ", "Θ", "Ω", "Α", "Λ", "□", "∇", "Δ"]
    reduced_signature: "Σ ∘ Ψ ∘ Ω ∘ Θ ∘ Χ  (forced settlement under binding, asymmetry, and time-compression; distance minimized)"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        The trolley setup is a high-control □ that compresses complex praxis into a forced binary.
        Its main function is to demand closure (a Σ-like output) rather than to represent realistic option spaces.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Ω is central: harm exposure is asymmetric (victims), while attribution exposure is concentrated
        on the decision-maker; observers may hold narrative power without bearing harm.
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ is compressed at the decision point (seconds), creating "now-or-never" closure pressure.
        Downstream Θ can be long (memory, record, identity binding to the decision).
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ is constitutive: the absent "harm-free" option becomes the load-bearing non-event that powers the dilemma.
        Additional Λ appears as missing forgiveness/repair/clarification events after the act.
      attractor_alpha: >
        As a cultural/practical pattern, trolley dilemmas stabilize as an attractor (Α): a repeatable
        argument template that reappears across domains (ethics, policy, AI safety) and can crowd out Φ.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ can reopen the frame by challenging premises (what counts as an option; what constraints are real),
        but under high publicness it can drift into substitution (rewriting as prosecution rather than revision).
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ is demanded as a single verdict output ("the right choice"), but joint integration may be structurally
        non-viable when bindings collide (Ψ). The forced Σ risks masquerading as moral proof rather than
        a scene-bound settlement.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ appears as: (i) binding to principles ("do not kill", "minimize harm"), (ii) identity attachment to
        one's choice, and (iii) institutional persistence if the output is recorded and reused.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ is structurally minimized by the frame ("no time"). Where Χ is delegitimized or punished, escalation
        into moralization and shaming becomes likely (D-risk) and revision becomes costly (Θ-hardening).
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signature is shorthand: in PMS, Χ depends on Φ/Θ/□; Σ depends on Χ/Φ; Ψ depends on Σ/Θ/Χ.
      Treating trolley outputs as "Σ without Χ" (instant verdict as proof) or externalizing Ψ as imposed
      obligation on others indicates drift and is invalid as PMS application.

    active_signatures:
      - signature_id: "DRIFT_binding_collision"
        title: "Binding collision (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Ψ + Ω + Θ + Σ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Trolley dilemmas often stage a collision between bindings (e.g., deontic restraint vs outcome minimization)
          under Θ-compression. The frame demands a Σ settlement, but the settlement may be structurally non-viable
          as a shared spine without costly premise changes.
      - signature_id: "DRIFT_asymmetry_lock_in"
        title: "Asymmetry lock-in (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Ω + Θ + Χ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          The decision-maker's attribution exposure and the victims' harm exposure are asymmetric; the frame prices
          Χ by making hesitation itself culpable. This locks the scene into a forced closure corridor.
      - signature_id: "DRIFT_exposure_capture"
        title: "Exposure capture (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Ω + Θ + Φ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          When trolley answers are discussed in public or institutional contexts, Φ (reframing) can be punished and
          treated as evasion. Interpretations harden into enforcement affordances and reputational sorting.
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "sigma_incompatibility_clash"
        label: "Σ-incompatibility (integration clash)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          The dilemma often encodes two coherent but incompatible integration spines (Σ₁ vs Σ₂) and then treats the
          demand for a single output as if it resolved the incompatibility.
      - drift_id: "binding_collision_drift"
        label: "Binding collision (Ψ-collision)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          The core structure is a collision of bindings under persistent coupling: principle-binding and outcome-binding
          remain jointly non-viable in the forced frame without reframing the premises.
      - drift_id: "exposure_capture_drift"
        label: "Exposure capture (Φ under Ω/Θ with scaled publicness)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          In discourse, trolley answers can become reputational signals; Φ-based nuance is penalized, so the scene drifts
          from description into verdict dynamics.
      - drift_id: "dignity_collapse_drift"
        label: "Dignity collapse (D-constraint failure under Ω/Θ)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Counting logic and forced settlement can enable shaming/ranking ("you would kill") and dehumanizing compression
          of affected parties into units, especially under publicness.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      The CONFLICT overlay makes explicit that trolley dilemmas are not "pure moral insight generators" but structured
      forced-closure scenes: they compress Θ, amplify Ω, minimize Χ, and demand Σ as verdict. It provides drift language
      to keep analysis finite and to block the conversion of dilemma outputs into person labels, governance authority,
      or enforcement affordances.

  drift_classification:
    drift_present: false
    drift_label: ""
    minimal_drift_signature: ""
    observable_markers:
      - "No drift classified without a concrete real-world scene artifact (this is a structural template)."

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Harm exposure is borne by affected parties; attribution and liability exposure is concentrated on the decision-maker.
      Observers may hold meaning/control power while bearing low harm exposure (Ω narrative gradient).
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Θ is compressed at the decision point, producing urgency. If answers are recorded or used for sorting, Θ hardens:
      revision becomes costly and reputationally coupled.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      The absent harm-free option is the constitutive Λ. Additional Λ persists as "no repair event that dissolves guilt/accusation"
      and "no definitive proof that the chosen metric was the right one."

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Declare the frame (□): what the dilemma is for (testing intuitions / mapping principles), and what it cannot settle."
      - "Maintain Χ: resist instant verdict-fusion; keep stop-capability explicit even if the frame pressures closure."
      - "Use Φ to inspect premises (option space, constraints, role assignments) without treating reframing as evasion."
      - "Keep Σ outputs scene-bound: treat any choice as a local settlement, not a moral proof or person verdict."
      - "Audit Ω: separate harm exposure from attribution exposure; do not convert asymmetry into shaming leverage."
      - "Preserve D: avoid dehumanizing compression and reputational prosecution, especially under publicness."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      The dilemma format invites ranking and shaming ("good people choose X"), and reduces affected parties to countable units.
      Under publicness, answers become legitimacy handles for sorting and prosecution.
    structural_indicator: >
      Χ collapses into urgency; Φ nuance is punished; Σ becomes verdict theater; Ψ is externalized as imposed moral obligation;
      person-level labels replace scene-bound structure; exposure capture escalates.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No claim that trolley dilemmas discover moral truth or settle ethics."
      - "No person evaluation or trait inference from a stated choice."
      - "No governance, policy, legal, or enforcement recommendation."
      - "No diagnosis of motives, empathy, or character."
    claimed:
      - "Trolley dilemmas are structurally forced-closure scenes: a □ that compresses Θ and amplifies Ω while minimizing Χ."
      - "They stage collisions of bindings (Ψ) and demand Σ as a single verdict, often masking non-viability of joint integration."
      - "Publicness can convert dilemma talk into exposure capture and dignity collapse; guardrails are structurally required."
    misuse_warning: >
      High misuse risk when trolley answers are used for selection/sorting, reputational prosecution, or moral ranking.
      Do not treat stated preferences as stable identity claims; do not weaponize the frame as an enforcement affordance.

  structural_closure: >
    The trolley dilemma is specified as a closure device: a framed forced-choice that makes harm unavoidable (Λ),
    compresses time (Θ), amplifies asymmetry of harm and attribution (Ω), and demands a single integrative output (Σ)
    under binding collisions (Ψ), with distance (Χ) structurally minimized. PMS–CONFLICT closes the case by keeping
    the output finite (structural legibility + drift boundaries) and blocking conversion into person verdicts or governance.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Trolley dilemmas force a quick choice where every option harms someone. Structurally, they compress time and
    push you to produce a single “answer,” even when different moral commitments can’t actually be merged without
    changing the premises. This case treats the dilemma as a framing device that creates closure pressure, not as
    a machine that proves who is right or who is good. It adds guardrails so the scenario isn’t used for shaming,
    sorting people, or turning a thought experiment into enforcement.
