  snapshot:
    short_case_description: |
      A quantum workflow uses explicit iteration (Θ) whose depth (k) materially affects resources, interpretability, and the credibility of claims.
      The governance task is to make Θ explicit within an explicit frame (□), bind it via policy (Ψ: k_max and admissible schedules), and preserve audit reversibility across commit points (Σ) so iteration semantics cannot be rewritten post-hoc (Φ).
      Risk arises when bounds or enforcement logs are missing (Λ), escalation becomes a default organisational attractor (Α), and audit artefacts are rhetorically treated as guarantees (Χ collapse / authority laundering).

    guiding_question: |
      Under which structural conditions does iteration depth remain a governed, auditable parameter (Θ bounded by Ψ within □ across Σ),
      and under which conditions does it become an IA-risk corridor (Λ missing bounds/logs, Α depth inflation, Φ post-hoc redefinition, audit-as-certificate drift)?

      description: |
        A structural governance pattern for iteration depth in quantum workflows: iteration (Θ) must be explicit within scope (□),
        bounded by enforceable and logged policy (Ψ), and tracked across commit points (Σ) so later reinterpretation (Φ) cannot silently rewrite what was committed.
        Missing bounds/logs (Λ) and organisational default escalation (Α) are treated as IA-risk mechanisms, especially where iteration amplifies role/control asymmetries (Ω).

      power_position_reflection: |
        In governance domains, analysis language can be misused as certification or blame allocation. This reading stays structure-only,
        keeps claims bounded (no performance/correctness), and treats misuse (audit-as-guarantee rhetoric) as an IA/D risk of transmission.
    publicity_degree: "institutional (parameterized)"

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: |
      - Protected constraint: analysis is structural; no correctness/performance guarantees; no person evaluation.
      - Governance must keep Θ explicit within □ and bounded by Ψ; Σ commits must be traceable and revision pathways explicit.
      - Audit reversibility must be preserved (parameter/version traceability; correction-ready documentation).
      - Anti-certification constraint: governance checks are audit conditions, not safety/correctness proof.
    variable_elements: |
      - Iteration embedding: fixed-k vs adaptive schedules vs laddered cycles; unrolled vs looped implementations.
      - Policy mechanisms: where Ψ lives (operator-level policy, orchestrator config, change-control board).
      - Logging/audit detail: granularity and retention of k, k_max, policy outcomes, Σ commits, and revisions.
      - Review cadence (TB): governance cycles, pre-commit gates, post-commit review windows, rollback mechanics.
      - Publicness level: internal workflow vs published claims vs compliance artefacts; audience effects on Φ risk.
    unfair_high_M_zones: |
      - If iteration bounds are implicit defaults imposed by tooling and actors lack real alternatives or visibility (Λ invisibility), attributing high individual M is structurally unfair (ceiling applies).
      - If Σ commits happen through institutional pipelines without accessible revision pathways, individual blame for later lock-in is capped.
      - If auditors are given traces that omit critical fields (missing logs), attributing high M for “not catching it” is capped.
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: |
      - “It’s just tuning” used to bypass governance semantics after Σ without Ψ revision/logging.
      - “The orchestrator handled it” used to avoid responsibility for declaring bounds and audit scope.
      - “We passed checks” used to treat governance as correctness/safety certification (authority laundering).

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: |
        Actors may know iteration depth impacts cost and interpretability, yet fail to treat Θ as a governed parameter requiring explicit scope (□),
        explicit bounds (Ψ), and auditable commit transitions (Σ). Under ∇ pressure, attention narrows to “make it work” rather than to audit legibility.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: |
        k not declared explicitly; k_max absent; policy checks not logged; iteration increased during troubleshooting without change control;
        post-hoc semantic shifts (“depth was only a compilation artefact”); governance language used as guarantee language.
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: |
        Confusing governance constraints with correctness guarantees; treating Θ escalation as harmless;
        underweighting Ω amplification via repetition; treating Σ as reversible by narrative (Φ) rather than by explicit revision policy (Ψ).
    coherence:
      official_narratives: |
        “We bounded iteration.” “We increased k for robustness.” “It passed governance checks.” “Depth is just tuning/implementation detail.”
      visible_enactments: |
        Iteration depth escalates under troubleshooting; bounds are implicit or undocumented; enforcement and logging are inconsistent;
        commit points freeze parameters without explicit revision path; post-hoc reframing reduces accountability instead of improving traceability.
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: |
        Coherence breaks when “bounded” is claimed but k/k_max are not explicit, when checks are asserted but not logged,
        when post-Σ narratives redefine depth semantics, or when audit artefacts are treated as certificates rather than revisable records.
    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: |
        - Declare Θ explicitly within □: iteration scope and what counts as “depth” must be defined.
        - Bind Θ via Ψ: enforce k_max/admissible schedules and log outcomes.
        - Mark Σ commits: freeze points must be visible; changes require explicit revision policy and trace.
        - Prevent Φ rewrite: no semantic redefinition of depth after Σ without Ψ-governed revision and logging.
        - Treat Λ as governance-relevant: missing bounds/logs are not neutral; they create audit invisibility.
        - Prevent audit-as-guarantee rhetoric: scope discipline must remain intact (Χ preserved).
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: |
        Responsibility is displaced into tooling (“the orchestrator did it”), into narratives (“it’s just tuning”), or into audit fetish (“we passed checks”).
        Alternatively, responsibility is shifted onto reviewers despite missing audit fields (Λ), or onto designers despite institutional control of Ψ policies.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: |
        Missing bounds/logs and post-hoc reframes increase audit ambiguity, enable over-claiming, and raise downstream trust and compliance risks.
        Third parties may adopt governance artefacts as proof of safety/correctness, amplifying authority laundering and reducing correction readiness.
    power:
      formal_power_distribution: |
        Typically distributed across design (workflow designers), execution (orchestrators), and oversight (auditors/review boards).
        Formal authority may be diffuse, but leverage concentrates where Θ can be changed and logs can be shaped.
      factual_power_distribution: |
        Power concentrates in who controls: iteration parameter injection, enforcement of k_max, logging defaults, and claim/publication channels.
        Ω steepens when iteration magnifies directional effects (oracle/control/measurement repetition) and when visibility is limited.
      used_alternatives: |
        - Escalating k to achieve outcomes under ∇ pressure.
        - Relying on default templates (Α) to reduce cognitive load.
        - Using narrative smoothing (“tuning”) to avoid re-audit costs.
        - Treating audit checks as reputational shield.
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: |
        - Making Θ/k/k_max explicit and first-class in operator governance.
        - Logging enforcement outcomes and making them reviewable.
        - Installing explicit TB review cadences and rollback pathways.
        - Publishing scope statements that block guarantee interpretations.
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: |
        D module remains OFF. D risk is handled structurally by preventing shaming/certification drift and keeping audit language correction-ready and scope-bound.

    course_in_words: |
      The pattern starts as governable design choice: Θ can be explicitly scoped and bounded.
      Under pressure, escalation can become the default if enforcement and logging are not explicit, creating audit invisibility (Λ) and organisational attractors (Α).
      After commitment, meaning control via post-hoc reframing (Φ) becomes the primary risk unless revision pathways are explicitly governed (Ψ) and recorded.
    responsibility_viability_range: |
      Viability is highest when Θ is explicit within □, bounded and logged via Ψ, and Σ commits are traceable with revision pathways.
      Viability collapses when bounds/logs are missing (Λ), escalation becomes an attractor (Α), and post-Σ narratives rewrite semantics (Φ), especially if audit artefacts are treated as guarantees.

      - What counts as Σ commit in this setting (execution submission, publication, compliance sign-off), and what revision/rollback exists?

      Counter-reading: In mature QC pipelines, Θ is always explicit and bounded by operator-level policy (Ψ) with strict logging;
      Σ commits are versioned with change control; publication channels enforce scope statements that block guarantees; and templates are routinely reviewed (TB).
      In such embeddings, escalation is governed, audit artefacts remain correction-ready, and IA risk is low.

  analyst_reflection:
    self_implication_notes: |
      Governance analyses can unintentionally become instruments of authority: either as pseudo-certification (“passed checks”) or as blame allocation.
      This reading therefore insists on scope discipline (no correctness/performance claims), treats missing evidence as a structural limitation (not a moral defect),
      and keeps formulations reversible and correction-ready.
    possible_next_steps: |
      - Add one concrete workflow vignette with the declared k/k_max, enforcement logs, and Σ commit trace.
      - Instantiate TB cadence: define governance review checkpoints and triggers for re-audit when depth changes.
      - Specify publicity context and add explicit anti-guarantee scope statements for any transmission.

    title: "Praxeological analysis of a practice pattern: QC workflow iteration-depth governance (Θ explicit, Ψ bounded, Σ traceable; anti-Φ post-hoc reframe)"
    one_paragraph_overview: |
      This reading analyses how “iteration depth” in a quantum workflow can be governed so that it stays visible, bounded, and auditable.
      The core idea is that iteration is not just an implementation detail: it must be explicitly scoped, bounded by enforceable policy, and recorded across commitment points so its meaning cannot be rewritten later.
      Risk arises when bounds or enforcement logs are missing, escalation becomes a default habit, and governance checks are treated as proof of correctness or safety.
      The analysis is structure-only and does not certify systems or assess individuals.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Iteration depth remains governance-legible when it is explicitly scoped and bounded by enforceable, logged policy; missing logs/bounds create audit invisibility."
      - "Commit points matter: after a workflow is committed or published, semantic rewrites of ‘depth’ become a primary risk unless revision pathways are explicitly governed."
      - "Organisational templates can stabilise depth escalation as a default, turning troubleshooting pressure into structural drift."
      - "Responsibility is leverage-dependent: highest where actors can set/enforce/log policies and control claims; capped where tooling and institutions constrain alternatives."
      - "Safe transmission requires anti-certification scope discipline: governance checks are audit conditions, not correctness or safety proof."
    maturity_summary: |
      In terms of maturity in practice, the pattern is adult-capable when iteration depth is treated as a governed parameter with explicit scope, enforceable bounds, and correction-ready audit traces across commitments.
    ia_box_summary: |
      Structurally, the asymmetry risk rises when transparency, time-bounds, or reversibility are not implemented in the governance of iteration depth, especially when audit artefacts are used as substitutes for justification.
    dignity_summary: ""
    trajectory_summary: |
      Over time, the case can move from governable design choices to escalation under troubleshooting pressure and then to lock-in and semantic rewrites after commitment if revision pathways are not explicit.
    open_questions_summary: |
      Important open questions are the concrete enforcement and logging setup, where commitment points occur, what review cadence exists, and what publicity or claim channel constraints apply.
    conclusion: |
      Use this case to keep iteration depth explicit, bounded, and auditable: define scope, enforce and log policies, mark commitments, and prevent post-hoc semantic rewrites.
      Avoid any use that treats governance checks as proof of correctness, safety, or advantage.
