        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can represent framed explanation-seeking (□, ∇), missing final grounds as
          structured non-events (Λ), and stabilization of "good enough" foundations as attractors (Α).
          The LOGIC overlay is required to formalize the boundary discipline of non-closure in justificatory
          chains (□ ∘ Λ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ) and to mark drift risks where regress pressure is resolved by illegitimate
          closure substitutions (Σ-totalization, □-overconstraint, Ω-inflated authority claims).

  scene_packet:
    scene_id: "LGC-GR-01"
    context: >
      Justification and explanation practices that demand "grounds" for claims, reasons, meanings, or
      reference (e.g., metaphysical grounding, epistemic justification chains, semantic grounding in use or
      world). The scene concerns escalation: each proposed ground is treated as requiring a further ground,
      generating regress or prompting a closure substitute.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Grounding demand inside an explicitly declared justificatory frame: what counts as a ground, what
        explains what, and what degree of closure is being sought (□). The frame determines admissible stopping
        points (if any) and acceptable non-closure handling.
      protected_constraints:
        - "No final, frame-independent 'ultimate ground' is presupposed."
        - "Non-closure (Λ) is admissible: absence of a terminating ground is structurally representable."
        - "Integration (Σ) coordinates grounds within scope; it does not generate metaphysical authority."
        - "Distance (Χ) is required to block closure laundering (coherence ≠ ultimate ground)."
        - "Reversibility: grounding strategies remain revisable under recontextualization (Φ)."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Metaphysical proof of an ultimate foundation as achieved result."
        - "Person-level competence/virtue judgments ('smart/dumb' grounding)."
        - "Normative enforcement ('you must accept this ground')."
        - "Psychological explanations of why someone seeks certainty."

    temporality:
      time_scale: "Iterative questioning cycles (minutes to years), with long-run stabilization of accepted bases."
      iteration_rhythm: "Ask for ground → propose ground → ask for ground of the ground → revise/stop/substitute."
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "Institutional or disciplinary standards for what counts as a ground (□ hardening)."
        - "Pedagogical transmission of canonical stopping points (Α-stabilization)."
        - "Rhetorical routines that reward definitive closure (Ω-mediated authority signals)."
      reversibility_window: >
        Revision remains available while the frame permits Φ-updates (redefinition of what counts as grounding,
        scope narrowing, or acceptance of Λ). Irreversibility increases when a stopping point is institutionalized
        as unquestionable closure.

    roles:
      - role_label: "R1_ground_seeker"
        function: "Requests further grounds; escalates the chain under ∇ toward closure."
        exposure_profile: "Exposure rises with stakes and with dependence on authoritative frames for stopping."
        notes: "Structural role; not a psychological profile."
      - role_label: "R2_ground_provider"
        function: "Supplies candidate grounds inside the frame; integrates chains (Σ) and proposes stop-conditions."
        exposure_profile: "Can accrue authority under Ω if their stopping points are treated as final."
        notes: "Includes teachers, experts, texts, institutions."
      - role_label: "R3_frame_setter"
        function: "Defines admissible grounding moves and what counts as termination (□)."
        exposure_profile: "High leverage: can enforce or relax non-closure tolerance; shapes downstream dependence."
        notes: "May be explicit (rules) or implicit (disciplinary culture)."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Difference between (i) local explanatory adequacy within a scope and (ii) the demand for an ultimate,
      terminating ground that ends the chain.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Impulse toward closure: the pressure to stop the regress by finding a final foundation, or by converting
      a provisional stopping point into authority.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "No terminating ground event appears that ends the chain without remainder."
      - "No final warrant event transforms an infinite regress into completed closure."
      - "No universally acceptable stop-rule emerges inside the frame without Φ-revision or scope restriction."

  operator_mapping:
    operator_chain: ["Σ", "Χ", "Φ", "Θ", "Ω", "Α", "Λ", "□", "∇", "Δ"]
    reduced_signature: "LOGIC_boundary_management + NON_CLOSURE_stability"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        The grounding demand is always □-relative: what counts as a ground depends on scope, standards, and
        permitted inference moves. Tight frames amplify regress pressure; explicit frames allow managed stopping.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Authority gradients shape whose stopping points count. Under Ω, regress can be resolved by deference
        rather than by boundary discipline (risk: authority capture).
      theta_temporality: >
        The regress unfolds over time through repeated iterations. Over time, provisional bases can harden into
        institutions, making later revision costly.
      lambda_residue: >
        The missing terminating ground is Λ: structured absence within the frame. Λ is not a failure signal but
        a boundary to be carried (or to trigger Φ-scope revision).
      attractor_alpha: >
        Practices stabilize around conventional stopping points ("axioms", "common sense", "definitions", "models")
        as attractors, even if they do not deliver ultimate grounds.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ is the structural repair move: shift the frame (what grounding means), narrow scope, change standards,
        or accept non-closure explicitly.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ organizes finite chains into usable coherence (explanatory coordination). Drift risk: treating Σ as
        metaphysical grounding rather than coordination.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ is optional: appears when communities/institutions self-bind to grounding policies (e.g., methodological
        foundations, axiomatic commitments, revision norms).
      distance_chi: >
        Χ blocks closure laundering: it preserves the distinction between "operational stopping" and "ultimate ground",
        and maintains revisability under Φ.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signatures are shorthand only. Any presentation of "Σ as final ground" without explicit Χ/Φ indicates
      drift risk (Σ-totalization). Χ presupposes Φ/Θ/□; Σ presupposes Χ/Φ. Regress-handling that denies Λ rather than
      carrying it is structurally unstable.

        title: "Logical boundary management (reduced signature)"
        formula: "□ ∘ Λ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Grounding regress is managed by integrating chains while explicitly carrying the non-termination boundary (Λ)
          within the frame (□); Χ prevents converting coherence into ultimate authority.
      - signature_id: "NON_CLOSURE_stability"
        title: "Sustainable non-closure (boundary attractor) (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Δ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Stabilization around non-termination: practices can remain functional by adopting stable stopping conventions
          while acknowledging that ultimate grounds are not delivered inside the frame.
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "dogmatism_sigma_totalization"
        label: "Dogmatism (Σ-totalization)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Regress pressure invites treating a local integration as a final foundation, denying Λ and immunizing the
          stopping point against Φ-driven revision.
      - drift_id: "technocratic_reduction_frame_overconstraint"
        label: "Technocratic reduction (□-overconstraint)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          A narrow frame may be treated as exhaustive reality, redefining "grounding" as whatever the frame can deliver,
          and erasing unmodeled remainder as irrelevant rather than Λ.
      - drift_id: "authority_capture_omega_inflation"
        label: "Authority capture (Ω-inflation)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          The regress may be stopped by deference to positional power (institution, expert, canon), converting Ω into
          justificatory authority and suppressing Χ.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      The LOGIC overlay makes the grounding regress legible as boundary management rather than as a defect to be fixed:
      Λ marks the structural absence of a terminating ground, while □ specifies scope and admissible stopping policies.
      Χ prevents the common substitution move where Σ-coherence becomes treated as metaphysical or epistemic finality,
      and the drift catalogue names how closure pressure typically weaponizes stopping points (dogma, overconstraint, authority).

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Under Ω, those who control frames or canonical stopping points can externalize uncertainty costs to others
      (downstream reliance), while retaining authority over what counts as "grounded."
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Over time, stopping points become embedded (education, methodology, infrastructure). Lock-in increases when
      stopping points are treated as irreversible foundations rather than revisable conventions.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      The demand for ultimate grounds remains structurally unmet; Λ persists and continues to generate closure pressure,
      inviting recurrent substitution attempts.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Declare the grounding frame (□): what counts as a ground, and what claim-strength is sought."
      - "Carry Λ explicitly: accept that termination may not be deliverable inside the frame."
      - "Use Φ to revise scope/standards rather than forcing closure (e.g., narrow the question or shift the kind of grounding)."
      - "Apply Χ to prevent coherence (Σ) from being converted into authority."
      - "Treat stabilized stopping conventions (Α) as functional attractors, not as ultimate grounds."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Grounding demands become tools of domination: regress is used to disqualify others, or a stopping point is enforced
      coercively via authority gradients (Ω).
    structural_indicator: >
      Suppression of Χ and denial of Λ: an imposed stopping point is treated as unquestionable, with □ made opaque and
      revision rights (Φ) blocked; disagreement is re-read as illegitimacy rather than as boundary pressure.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "A proof of an ultimate foundation that ends grounding regress."
      - "A universal stop-rule valid across all frames."
      - "A psychological diagnosis of certainty-seeking."
      - "A prescriptive demand about what anyone must accept."
    claimed:
      - "Grounding regress is a structural non-closure (Λ) within justification frames (□) under closure pressure (∇)."
      - "Functional stability can arise via attractors (Α) and integration (Σ) without yielding ultimate grounds."
      - "LOGIC discipline manages the boundary: carry Λ within □, apply Χ to prevent Σ-totalization, and allow Φ-driven revision."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use regress as a humiliation device, and do not enforce stopping points as unquestionable authority.
      Do not deny Λ by substituting dogma or by converting institutional power (Ω) into justificatory necessity.

  structural_closure: >
    Grounding regress is specified as an iterative closure-demand configuration: each proposed ground is framed (□) and
    integrated (Σ) while the terminating ground event remains absent (Λ). Practice stabilizes through attractors (Α) and
    time-embedded conventions (Θ), but the boundary persists. PMS–LOGIC closes the case by articulating boundary discipline:
    make frames explicit, carry Λ, use Φ to revise scope, and apply Χ to block conversion of coherence into ultimate authority.

  plain_language_summary: >
    When we ask “what is the ultimate reason?” we can keep asking for a reason behind the reason. Nothing automatically
    happens that forces the chain to end. PMS–LOGIC treats that as a real structural limit: you can still build usable
    explanations by being clear about the scope, staying open to revision, and not pretending that a coherent stopping
    point is the same as an ultimate foundation.
