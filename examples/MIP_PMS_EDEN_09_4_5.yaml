      - overlay: EDEN
      - core motifs: repair as carrier restoration (Χ real + Σ enacted + Ψ→Self) under Ω/Θ with Λ residues and Α scripts;
        drift corridor: □→tribunal/value-relation; Χ priced; Σ simulated; Ψ→Other; Λ denied/retained; reciprocity loss under Θ.
    secondary_material: ""
    assumptions_and_inferences: |
      - Template-level reading only (no identifiable persons/institutions; no concrete vignette).
      - “Repair” is treated descriptively as a scene-bound coordination carrier restoration problem (Σ/Ψ reopening), not as moral settlement.
      - Primary IA risk corridor: □ tribunal drift where verification/clarification (Χ) becomes socially priced, Σ is simulated,
        and Ψ externalizes (“you must forgive/trust/stop asking”), with Λ residues denied or retained as leverage.
      - Responsibility allocation (M) is leverage-dependent: higher where actors control disclosure/commitment channels and can keep Χ/Σ accessible;
        lower where alternatives are structurally constrained and Ω exposure is high.

  snapshot:
    short_case_description: |
      A recurring repair pattern where residues (Λ) have accumulated across time (Θ) under real exposure gradients (Ω),
      and repair attempts (apology/clarification/renegotiation) either re-open the carriers of coordination (Χ real, Σ enacted, Ψ→Self)
      or drift into substitutes (□ tribunal framing, Χ punished, Σ simulated, Ψ→Other demands), stabilizing scripts (Α) and eroding reciprocity under Θ.

      - "R3_audience_institution_optional"
    guiding_question: |
      How can repair remain a praxis-relation process that keeps verification/clarification (Χ) permitted,
      converts residues (Λ) into concrete interface repair (Σ), and re-establishes owned commitments (Ψ→Self),
      so Ω gradients are handled transparently and tribunal/value-relation drift does not take over under Θ?

  role_mapping:
    object_of_observation:
      type: "practice_pattern"
      label: "Repair relationships under chronic Λ and Ω/Θ with tribunal-drift risk"
      description: |
        A regime where repair is attempted after accumulated non-closures. Viable repair requires Χ to remain real (questions/verification allowed),
        Σ to be enacted (concrete interface change), and Ψ to be self-bound (owned commitments across Θ) under Ω gradients.
        Drift risk: □ shifts into tribunal/value-relation, Χ is priced/punished, Σ is simulated, and Ψ externalizes into demands on the other.

    analyst_role:
      description: "Template-level structural analyst; not adjudicating who is right, who should forgive, or prescribing sanctions."
      power_position_reflection: |
        Analyst language can itself convert repair dynamics into person labels or coercive closure scripts.
        This reading stays role-bound, avoids psychological inference, and treats remedies as design variables (Χ/Σ/Ψ hygiene; Ω speakability).
    publicity_degree: "variable (parameterized)"

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: |
      - Repair is treated as carrier restoration: keep Χ permitted, convert Λ residues into Σ interface change, and re-establish Ψ→Self across Θ.
      - Protected constraint: no shaming/loyalty tests/forced forgiveness; D module remains OFF but dignity is protected structurally.
      - Entry constraint: no irreversible person claims; repair remains scene-bound and revisable.
      - Ω gradients are functional coordinates (who bears cost/risk/leverage), not verdict surfaces.
    variable_elements: |
      - Embedding: pair vs team vs institutional dyad; presence/absence of formal mandate and role authority.
      - Publicness/records coupling: private repair vs institutional logs/HR/process coupling vs public narratives.
      - Default design: what counts as “repair,” what is checked vs assumed; update cadence; disclosure norms.
      - Channel control: who can pause, ask questions, document, escalate, and redefine “repair.”
      - Repair mechanics: existence of explicit Χ windows, Σ pathways (interface changes), and commitment tracking (Ψ→Self).
    unfair_high_M_zones: |
      - Where R1 has low alternatives/high dependency and Χ is priced, assigning high M for “not moving on” or “not trusting repair” is unfair.
      - Where R2 controls disclosure and commitment channels and imposes closure, R1 M is capped; institutional/role M rises.
      - Where the setting structurally discourages verification or interface change, blaming individuals for persistent Λ misses the system axiom.
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: |
      - “We can’t revisit this” used indefinitely (Θ) without minimal checkpoints or repair windows (TB/Χ).
      - “Repair means you stop asking” used to deny verification and treat Χ as betrayal (pricing revision).
      - “We apologized / we said the words” used to launder Σ-simulation and avoid Ψ→Self ownership.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: |
        Actors may notice recurring residues (Λ) and that rituals of repair do not change outcomes, but treat this as interpersonal friction
        rather than as a design issue: whether Χ is real, Σ exists, and Ψ is self-bound under Ω/Θ.
        R2 may underestimate how Θ accumulation and Ω gradients make “closure” asymmetric for R1.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: |
        Repeated “we already talked about this”; pressure for silence; defensiveness at questions; apology/performance without follow-through;
        avoidance scripts (Α); rising monitoring/withdrawal; tribunal framing (who is good/bad) replacing interface work (Σ).
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: |
        Confusing repair with moral settlement; treating verification (Χ) as disrespect; ignoring Ω gradients in who pays repair labor and risk;
        treating chronic Λ as “nothing”; treating refusal to close as “character flaw”; converting repair into entitlement to compel (Ψ→Other).
    coherence:
      official_narratives: |
        “We apologized, so it’s resolved.” “If you bring it up again, you’re punishing me.”
        “Repair means moving on.” “We’re fine now.” (institutional variant: “We followed the process, so it’s closed.”)
      visible_enactments: |
        Repair attempts occur episodically; questions trigger defensiveness; Φ narrative moves preserve face; Σ interface change is delayed or symbolic;
        commitment ownership is vague; closure is demanded; scripts stabilize (Α): avoidance, performance repair, monitoring, or exit.
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: |
        Coherence breaks when “repair” is claimed while Χ is punished, Σ does not change, and Ψ→Self is absent—especially when Ω costs remain one-sided.
    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: |
        - Keep repair reversible (Χ): allow questions/verification without humiliation; protect pauses and re-opening.
        - Convert residues (Λ) into Σ: implement at least one concrete interface change after repeated episodes.
        - Re-establish Ψ→Self: owned commitments carried across Θ; avoid Ψ→Other demands as repair criteria.
        - Make Ω gradients speakable: name who bears repair labor/risk and rebalance where possible.
        - If records/publicness exist: ensure correction propagation so repaired facts update downstream narratives/logs.
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: |
        Responsibility may shift into denial (“nothing happened”), diffusion (“we both did things”), or coercive closure (“you must forgive/stop asking”).
        R3 can reinforce diffusion by rewarding harmony displays while no one owns interface repair.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: |
        R1 may withdraw, increase monitoring, or exit; repair attempts become more conflictual or stop altogether.
        Third parties learn that repair is performance, not carrier restoration, and that verification is socially punished.
    power:
      formal_power_distribution: |
        Variable. R2 may hold formal authority (role mandate, gatekeeping, policy control) or informal standing that defines closure terms.
        R1 may have limited exit/alternatives. R3 (institution/audience) can set meaning via records/metrics.
      factual_power_distribution: |
        Power concentrates where channel control exists: who can define “repair,” who can refuse re-opening, who controls disclosure and documentation,
        who can frame questions as betrayal, and who benefits from closure optics. Publicness/records steepen Ω and harden Θ.
      used_alternatives: |
        - Using Φ narrative repair to reduce immediate conflict without Σ change.
        - Converting repair into standing allocation (□ tribunal) to avoid interface work.
        - Imposing closure as loyalty test (Ψ→Other) to price Χ and preserve unilateral defaults.
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: |
        - Explicit repair windows and “repair-safe” language for verification (Χ protection).
        - Lightweight Σ moves: change boundaries, checkpoints, disclosure norms, restitution forms.
        - Time-bounded closure (TB): review windows/sunset clauses for “we are repaired” claims.
        - Independent facilitation or documentation rules when publicness/records amplify drift risk.
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: |
        D module remains OFF. D risk is handled structurally: avoid shaming/forced forgiveness and keep verification/repair (Χ/Σ) dignity-safe.

  ia_protection:
    transparency_measures: |
      - Define repair carriers explicitly: what counts as Χ (re-opening/verification), what counts as Σ (interface change), what counts as Ψ→Self (owned commitments).
      - Make Ω gradients explicit: who bears repair labor, exposure, and downstream risk; who controls channels and documentation.
      - Name the drift corridor: tribunal framing and forced closure (Ψ→Other) that prices Χ and simulates Σ.
    time_bound_measures: |
      - Install review windows after repair claims (e.g., check-in after N cycles / weeks).
      - Use “sunset closure”: any “it’s repaired” claim is auto-reviewed after defined time or recurrence.
      - Trigger review when recurring Λ residues, punished questions, or withdrawal/monitoring spikes appear (Θ escalation indicators).
    reversibility_measures: |
      - Protect Χ: allow re-opening, clarification, and verification without humiliation; define repair-safe language and escalation paths.
      - Ensure Σ pathways: after repeated Λ, implement one concrete interface change (boundary, checkpoint, disclosure, restitution form).
      - If records/publicness exist: implement correction propagation so repaired facts update downstream narratives/logs and prevent Θ hardening.

        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 4–8/10 (highest where channels/records are controlled)"
    course_in_words: |
      The pattern often begins with plausible repair attempts under manageable residues. Over time, missing acknowledgment/disclosure or absent interface change becomes structurally active (Λ) and scripts stabilize (Α).
      Without protected re-opening (Χ) and concrete Σ/Ψ→Self restoration, framing can drift into tribunal closure, making questions costly and repairs counterfeit.
      Under Θ, cooperation shifts toward monitoring, avoidance, or exit; “repair” becomes a standing device rather than carrier restoration.
    responsibility_viability_range: |
      Viability is highest when repair remains revisable (Χ real), repeated Λ triggers concrete Σ adjustments, and commitments are owned as Ψ→Self across Θ with Ω gradients speakable.
      Viability collapses when repair prices Χ, simulates Σ, and externalizes binding (Ψ→Other), while Ω exposure remains one-sided under Θ.

    unclear_points: |
      - What is the concrete embedding (pair/team/institution) and who holds formal mandate over repair definitions and closure?
      - What is the publicity/records coupling and how does it shape Ω and Θ hardening?
      - Which repair carriers are currently available: can R1 re-open (Χ) without punishment; what counts as Σ in this setting?
      - What concrete Ψ→Self commitments are possible/trackable, and what triggers commitment revision?
      - Is there a correction propagation rule for documentation/records after repair?
    missing_data_or_perspectives: |
      - R1 perspective: perceived cost of re-opening and real alternatives (dependency / exit options).
      - R2 perspective: constraints, fears, and willingness to adopt explicit Σ/Ψ→Self and protect Χ.
      - R3 perspective: what is rewarded/punished (harmony vs repair capacity) and how records amplify tribunal drift.
    distortion_risks: |
      - Moralization drift (repair framed as virtue/vice rather than carrier mechanics).
      - Overfitting to coercion narratives where time pressure, shame sensitivity, or tragedy constraints dominate.
      - Under-weighting legitimate anti-tribunal / anti-surveillance norms and over-weighting “always revisit.”

      Counter-reading: In many settings, limiting revisiting can protect stability and prevent endless tribunal dynamics; closure rituals may be legitimate if (1) re-opening (Χ) remains permitted under clear conditions,
      (2) at least one concrete interface change (Σ) occurs after recurrence, (3) commitments are owned (Ψ→Self), and (4) Ω gradients are not one-sided or are explicitly rebalanced.

  analyst_reflection:
    self_implication_notes: |
      This analysis risks laundering authority by treating re-opening as always justified or by casting closure as manipulation by default.
      Therefore it stays structural, avoids person labels, and treats “more re-opening” as one option among others, with anti-tribunal and dignity constraints.
    possible_next_steps: |
      - Add one concrete vignette and map: which residues (Λ) persisted, when re-opening (Χ) was permitted/punished, what Σ changes occurred, and what Ψ→Self commitments were owned across Θ under Ω.
      - Instantiate TB: define review cadence and sunset closure rules for “repaired” claims.
      - If records/publicness exist: instantiate correction propagation and amplification guardrails.

  uniform_report:
    title: "Praxeological analysis of a practice pattern: Repair relationships under chronic Λ and Ω/Θ"
    one_paragraph_overview: |
      This reading treats “repair” as restoring the carriers that make coordination viable, not as moral settlement or a verdict about persons.
      Repair works when people can re-open and verify without punishment (Χ), make at least one concrete interface change that reduces recurrence (Σ),
      and carry owned commitments over time (Ψ→Self) under real exposure gradients (Ω). When repair drifts into tribunal framing, questions become costly,
      changes are simulated, and closure is imposed on others (“you must forgive/stop asking”). Then residues remain active and accumulate, scripts stabilize,
      and cooperation erodes across time.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Risk mechanism: residues (Λ) accumulate under Θ and stabilize scripts (Α) when repair lacks concrete Σ and owned Ψ→Self."
      - "Drift corridor: □ can flip into tribunal/value-relation; verification/re-opening (Χ) becomes priced; Σ is simulated; Ψ externalizes (Ψ→Other)."
      - "IA risk rises when the repair regime is not transparent about Ω gradients, not justified by real carrier restoration, not time-bounded by reviews, and not reversible through protected Χ and Σ."
      - "Responsibility is leverage-dependent: highest where disclosure/closure channels and records are controlled; lower where alternatives are constrained and Ω exposure is high."
      - "Safer repair keeps re-opening protected, converts repeated Λ into small Σ changes, and stabilizes commitments as Ψ→Self across Θ."
    maturity_summary: |
      In terms of maturity in practice, the pattern supports adult enactment when repair remains revisable and carrier-based (Χ+Σ+Ψ→Self) under Ω/Θ rather than tribunal-based closure.
    ia_box_summary: |
      Structurally, IA risk increases when repair is opaque about who controls channels and bears costs, when closure is imposed without carrier restoration, when no review cadence exists, and when re-opening is practically punished.
    dignity_summary: ""
    trajectory_summary: |
      Over time, the case often shifts from repair-capable re-opening to stabilized residues and performance rituals, and then to tribunal drift where re-opening is priced and reciprocity erodes under Θ.
    open_questions_summary: |
      Important open questions are the concrete embedding and publicness/records coupling, who controls re-opening and commitment channels, whether concrete Σ pathways exist, and whether correction propagation exists where records harden narratives.
    conclusion: |
      Use this case to keep repair from becoming a tribunal: protect re-opening as repair capacity, require at least one concrete interface change after recurrence, make Ω gradients speakable, and treat closure claims as time-bounded and revisable.
