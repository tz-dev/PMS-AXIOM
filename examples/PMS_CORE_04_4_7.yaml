    context: >
      An invariance claim is demanded: across transformations, reuses, contexts, or measurements,
      something is asserted to remain "the same" (e.g., a conserved quantity, a stable property,
      a preserved relation, a policy invariant, a role-invariant, an equivalence class).
      The dispute is not about inner experience but about how invariance closure is produced,
      stabilized, contested, and sometimes enforced within frames. PMS treats invariance here
      as a structural practice of sameness-under-transformation for coordination and inference,
      not as a metaphysical guarantee about the world-in-itself.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Invariance is scoped as a frame-bound criterion of sameness-under-transformation (□):
        what counts as an admissible transformation, what counts as the "same", and what level
        of tolerance/error is acceptable are defined by the frame (mathematics/physics, engineering,
        measurement systems, institutional policy, role design, narrative identity claims).
        Outputs are bounded: "within this frame and transformation set, an invariant is supported"
        vs "underdetermined or fragile (Λ)".
      protected_constraints:
        - "No metaphysical proof of invariance is claimed"
        - "No person-level blame, trait inference, or intent attribution is derived from invariance language"
        - "Invariance claims must declare the frame (□) and the transformation set / equivalence relation"
        - "Temporal grain (Θ) must be declared when invariance is asserted across time or regimes"
        - "Reversibility discipline applies: invariance claims are revisable under recontextualization (Φ) or non-events (Λ)"
        - "Dignity-in-practice (D) constrains how invariance claims may be used under asymmetry (Ω)"
      out_of_frame:
        - "Invariance as an ontological substance or final metaphysical fact"
        - "Totalizing invariance claims that override declared frames and tolerances"
        - "Psychological diagnosis or moral ranking justified by invariance talk"
    temporality:
      time_scale: "single transformations to long-horizon regime stability and drift (Θ)"
      iteration_rhythm: "repeat cycles: propose invariant → test/contest → refine frame → restabilize"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "formal definitions, measurement protocols, and records that preserve invariants (□/Θ)"
        - "repeatable heuristics and defaults that become invariance habits (Α)"
        - "standards, policies, or theorems that bind invariance criteria (Σ→Ψ when formalized)"
      reversibility_window: >
        Invariance assignments remain revisable while alternative transformation sets remain admissible (Φ),
        while evidence is incomplete or noisy (Λ), and while binding doctrine has not fixed the criterion (Ψ).
        Where binding exists (e.g., standard, theorem, compliance doctrine), revision requires explicit
        re-integration (Σ) and re-authorization within the frame (□).
    roles:
      - role_label: "Invariant proposer (modeler / theorist / designer)"
        function: "Proposes sameness-under-transformation criterion usable for coordination and inference"
        exposure_profile: "Medium; exposed to counterexamples, precision demands, and frame disputes"
        notes: "Operates via □ definition of transformations and Σ integration of constraints; must preserve Λ residue when present."
      - role_label: "Tester / counterexample role (auditor / experimenter / adversary)"
        function: "Probes whether the invariance survives transformations; produces misfit evidence (Δ/Λ)"
        exposure_profile: "Variable; can be costly under institutional Ω when challenging stabilized invariants"
        notes: "Not evaluated; treated as structurally tasked with making failure modes legible."
      - role_label: "Standard-setter / authority (institution, committee, regulator, maintainers)"
        function: "Stabilizes invariance criteria as binding definitions or compliance requirements"
        exposure_profile: "High leverage, lower exposure; can externalize costs of misfit"
        notes: "Represents Ω gradients that convert provisional invariants into durable bindings (Ψ)."
      - role_label: "Affected implementer (operator / user / subject role)"
        function: "Must enact the invariant in practice (measurement, compliance, interoperability)"
        exposure_profile: "High; bears costs of false invariance, drift, or mis-specified transformation sets"
        notes: "Not evaluated; treated as structurally exposed to lock-in and enforcement under Ω."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      A contrast becomes salient: outputs differ across transformations, contexts, or measurements
      (same input → different result; same label → different behavior; same policy → different outcomes).
      Δ sharpens the question: "what changed" vs "what must remain the same".
    nabla_impulse: >
      Strong closure demand to locate an invariant: enable prediction, interoperability, fairness of comparison,
      reproducibility, portability, accountability, or coordination. ∇ tends to compress multi-level variation
      into a single preserved feature even when the transformation set is contested.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "Expected proof/derivation does not arrive (missing justification for invariance under the declared transformations)."
      - "Expected robustness does not occur (invariant fails under edge cases or regime shifts)."
      - "Expected agreement on transformation set/tolerance does not occur (persistent frame dispute)."

    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        Invariance is produced inside □: the transformation group/equivalence relation, admissible noise,
        and decision thresholds are frame-dependent (formal proof vs empirical tolerance vs policy constraint).
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Ω appears when authorities can impose invariance criteria (standards, compliance, grading regimes);
        affected roles bear misfit costs. Ω gradients can convert convenience invariants into enforced obligations.
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ matters whenever invariance is asserted across time or regimes: drift, accumulation, delayed failure,
        and path dependence determine whether invariance is stable or only locally valid.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ appears as underdetermination (multiple candidate invariants), missing proof, noisy evidence,
        counterfactual opacity, or edge-case gaps. PMS preserves Λ rather than laundering closure.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Α stabilizes invariance heuristics: "this is the conserved feature" becomes a reusable script,
        sometimes dominating even when Λ is high or Φ has shifted the scene.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ shifts invariance by embedding the same claim into a new frame: proof → measurement protocol →
        compliance regime → narrative coordination. Φ changes what counts as the relevant transformation
        and what "same" is supposed to preserve.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ integrates constraints (transformations, tolerances, exception handling, measurement design)
        into a coherent invariance package usable for the frame, without implying metaphysical finality.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ hardens invariance into binding doctrine (theorem, standard, policy invariant, interface contract).
        Ψ is structurally expensive and requires Χ + explicit reversibility handling (revision hooks, scope declarations).
      distance_chi: >
        Χ prevents premature invariant-totalization: keeps claims scoped to transformations and frames,
        blocks "invariant = essence" slides, and maintains revisability—especially under Ω enforcement pressure.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Typical hygiene failure: jumping from Δ/∇ directly to Ψ ("this must be invariant") without specifying □
      (transformation set), without preserving Λ (edge cases, missing proof), without tracking Φ (frame drift),
      and without Σ integration (tolerances and exception handling) under Χ. Valid PMS application keeps invariance
      frame-bound, transformation-explicit, revisable, and dignity-constrained.

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Standard-setters can impose invariance criteria; implementers and affected roles bear the costs of
      false invariance (breakage, compliance failure, misclassification). Contest capacity over invariance
      is uneven under Ω.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Once invariants are recorded as standards, proofs, interfaces, or policies, they become sticky:
      revision requires coordination, migration, and re-authorization. Early closure creates path dependence,
      and regime shifts reveal delayed failure modes.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Residue load consists of edge cases, tolerance disputes, transformation-set disagreement, noisy measurements,
      and multiple admissible invariants. Λ can remain high even when coordination must proceed.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Declare the frame (□) and the admissible transformation set before asserting invariance."
      - "State temporal grain (Θ) explicitly when invariance is claimed across time/regimes; watch for drift."
      - "Make Λ explicit (edge cases, missing proof, tolerance uncertainty) instead of forcing closure."
      - "Track Φ when invariance is transported into a new frame (proof → measurement → compliance)."
      - "Use Σ to integrate tolerances, exceptions, and measurement protocols rather than compressing to a slogan."
      - "Apply Χ to resist invariant-totalization under Ω; keep reversibility live unless Ψ is legitimately required."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Invariance language is used to impose coercive closure: treating a frame-bound invariant as an essence,
      using it to justify exclusion, humiliation, or irreversible status assignment, especially where Ω reduces
      the subject's ability to contest the criterion.
    structural_indicator: >
      Ψ-hardening without Χ: a provisional invariant becomes a binding verdict; Λ is suppressed; Φ shifts are ignored;
      alternative Σ integrations are disallowed; costs are externalized down Ω gradients.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No metaphysical proof or final ontology of invariance is provided."
      - "No single correct invariant is guaranteed in complex or contested frames."
      - "No person-level evaluation or moral ranking is derived from invariance claims."
      - "No enforcement guidance for institutions is provided."
    claimed:
      - "Invariance is modeled as a frame-bound (□) sameness-under-transformation practice stabilized by Α and Θ."
      - "Λ residues (edge cases, underdetermination, missing proof, tolerance disputes) are preserved as structural outputs."
      - "Σ integrates constraints into usable invariance packages; Ψ explains binding into standards, proofs, or policies."
      - "Χ + reversibility + D constrain invariance language under Ω."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use this case to weaponize invariance for exclusion, coercion, or irreversible labeling.
      Outputs are structural descriptions of how invariance closure operates within frames, not verdicts about persons.

  structural_closure: >
    PMS reframes invariance as a structural closure configuration: Δ makes variation across transformations legible;
    ∇ pressures sameness-under-transformation closure; □ defines admissible transformations and tolerances; Λ marks
    underdetermination and edge-case gaps; Α stabilizes invariance heuristics as reusable scripts; Ω shapes who can
    impose invariants and who bears misfit costs; Θ determines stability across time/regimes; Φ shifts invariance
    meaning across frames; Σ integrates constraints into coherent invariance packages; Ψ binds selected packages
    into standards, proofs, or policies. Where closure exceeds what the frame can warrant, Λ remains explicit.

  plain_language_summary: >
    This case treats “invariance” as something we build so we can treat different situations as comparable:
    we decide which changes count as “the same situation,” and what feature should stay stable across those changes.
    Sometimes this works well, but edge cases, noise, and context shifts can make the invariant fragile or disputed.
    Repeated use can make an invariant feel obvious and become a standard, even when uncertainty remains.
    The aim is to keep invariance claims explicit about their scope, revisable when evidence or contexts change,
    and non-coercive when power differences determine who bears the consequences of the chosen invariant.
