        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can represent trust structurally as a framed default (□) that treats
          certain expected checks, disclosures, or confirmations as not-required (Λ),
          stabilizes reliability scripts (Α), allocates verification/monitoring costs under
          exposure gradients (Ω), and accumulates consequences over time (Θ), with repair and
          clarification enabled via Φ/Χ and coordination consolidated via Σ/Ψ.
          PMS core alone, however, does not explicitly formalize the EDEN-typical drift corridor
          where “trust talk” becomes a standing/tribunal device: (i) □ drifts from praxis-relation
          (coordination credit) to value-relation (loyalty test / ranking), (ii) Λ (missing
          transparency / missing follow-through) is retained as leverage or treated as “nothing
          happened,” (iii) Σ is bypassed or simulated while Ψ is externalized (Ψ→Other: “you must
          trust me”) or misbound to appearance-management, and (iv) stabilization proceeds through
          pseudo-symmetry and reciprocity erosion under Θ with real Ω still operative.
          The EDEN overlay supplies regime labels, reduced signatures, and drift corridors that keep
          trust legible as a structural coordination regime (or substitution pattern) rather than
          as inner-state psychology, intent attribution, or moral diagnosis.

  scene_packet:
    scene_id: "trust_regime_default_assumptions_micro_to_mid_scale"
    context: >
      A recurring praxis scene (team/partnership/institution) where cooperation depends on
      delegated action and reduced verification. “Trust” functions as a coordination regime:
      some checks are skipped, disclosures are deferred, and commitments are presumed stable.
      Over time, residues (Λ) appear (missed follow-through, missing transparency, unacknowledged
      costs), while exposure and responsibility remain uneven (Ω) and consequences accumulate
      (Θ). The regime either remains repair-capable (Χ/Σ/Ψ available) or drifts into trust-as-demand
      and trust-as-standing (□ drift), where questions are punished and coordination is replaced
      by loyalty signaling.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Trust as coordination credit: a framed default (□) that permits reduced monitoring and
        assumes reliability across time (Θ) while preserving reversibility windows (Χ), explicit
        repair/integration capacity (Σ), and self-bound follow-through ownership (Ψ→Self).
        Trust is treated as a scene-bound regime for handling uncertainty and verification costs,
        not as a global person property and not as a tribunal for allocating moral worth.
      protected_constraints:
        - "Trust is scene-bound and role-bound (no global person labels like 'trustworthy/untrustworthy')."
        - "Reversibility: trust defaults are revisable; questions and verification remain permitted (Χ real)."
        - "D (dignity-in-practice): no shaming, humiliation, or loyalty tests as substitutes for coordination."
        - "Ω is speakable as a functional gradient (who bears verification cost, exposure, and downstream risk)."
        - "Trust claims do not convert into automatic obligations imposed on others (no Ψ→Other coercion)."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Psychological inference ('they fear intimacy', 'they are paranoid', 'they are manipulative')."
        - "Moral verdicts or character diagnoses (good/bad person, virtue scoring)."
        - "Sanction/enforcement playbooks or governance policies."
        - "Irreversible labels ('never trust X') and totalizing life-history claims."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "mid_to_long (weeks to years)"
      iteration_rhythm: "recurrent cycles (daily/weekly delegation with periodic stress tests)"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "delegation histories and remembered follow-through"
        - "implicit defaults (what is 'normally' checked vs skipped)"
        - "documentation/logs in institutional settings"
        - "role stabilization into scripts (Α) and path dependence under Θ"
      reversibility_window: >
        Initially broad (defaults can be renegotiated), later shrinking if Θ accumulates
        unresolved residues (Λ), scripts stabilize (Α), and verification becomes socially
        priced (Χ treated as betrayal rather than as repair capacity).
    roles:
      - role_label: "R1: Higher-exposure / higher-cost bearer"
        function: >
          Bears more downstream risk if trust defaults fail (cleanup, reputational exposure,
          safety, workload). Often pays verification/monitoring cost when the regime is unstable.
        exposure_profile: "high exposure / consequence gradient (Ω↑)"
        notes: "Risk: chronic Λ becomes an open account; Χ (questions/verification) becomes costly."
      - role_label: "R2: Lower-exposure / trust-invoking role-position"
        function: >
          Benefits from reduced verification and can invoke trust language to preserve speed,
          discretion, or appearance. May carry fewer immediate costs when follow-through fails.
        exposure_profile: "variable; often lower immediate exposure (Ω asymmetrically priced)"
        notes: "May substitute Φ (narrative repair) for Σ (interface change); may externalize Ψ."
      - role_label: "R3: Audience / institution / third parties (optional)"
        function: >
          Rewards harmony signals, penalizes 'distrust talk,' or operationalizes trust via metrics.
          Can accelerate □ drift into standing/loyalty framing.
        exposure_profile: "low direct cost; high amplification power"
        notes: "Can convert trust into ranking or compliance tests; can harden Θ via records."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      A mismatch between (a) the trust default claims (“no need to check / it’s fine / we’re aligned”)
      and (b) observed outcomes, costs, or exposure distributions that indicate real uncertainty and risk.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Closure pressure toward speed and reduced friction (“just trust”), or counter-pressure toward
      verification and clarification when consequences become salient. Often paired with avoidance impulse
      to prevent trust from creating explicit obligations (recognition, follow-through, transparency).
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "Expected disclosure/transparency does not occur (missing context, missing evidence, missing update)."
      - "Follow-through is delayed or absent without acknowledgment (commitment remains implicit)."
      - "Repair conversation does not occur; questions are deflected or reframed (Φ without Σ)."
      - "Revisions are not permitted socially; verification is treated as betrayal (Χ priced)."
      - "Binding ownership is not self-adopted; responsibility is pushed onto the other (Ψ→Other)."

  operator_mapping:
    operator_chain: ["Ψ", "Σ", "Χ", "Φ", "Θ", "Ω", "Α", "Λ", "□", "∇", "Δ"]
    reduced_signature: >
      TRUST = □(coordination default) + Λ(reduced checks assumed) + Α(reliability scripts)
      under real Ω across Θ, carried by Χ(revisable verification) + Σ(interface repair) + Ψ(self-bound follow-through).
      (risk corridor: □ drift → loyalty/standing + Λ chronic + Χ priced → Σ low/simulated + Ψ externalized/misbound)
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        □ determines whether trust functions as praxis-relation coordination credit (reducing monitoring while
        preserving repair capacity) or drifts into value-relation (loyalty test / tribunal). In □-drift,
        “trust” becomes standing language and blocks functional Ω talk and Σ work.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Trust regimes allocate who pays verification cost and who bears downstream risk. If Ω is real but not
        speakable, trust becomes asymmetrically priced: one side bears exposure while the other gains friction
        reduction and deniability.
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ accumulates: each skipped check or unresolved residue compounds into trajectory effects (risk
        escalation, withdrawal, demand loops). Later “clarification” is less effective once scripts harden.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ (missing disclosure, missing follow-through, missing acknowledgment) is not nothing; it persists as
        open residue, can become leverage, and can be reinterpreted as pseudo-evidence inside tribunal frames.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Α stabilizes trust scripts (smooth delegation, “we don’t need to check”) or drift scripts (trust-as-demand,
        avoidance, loyalty signaling, conflict suppression).
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ can legitimately recalibrate trust defaults (new context, new constraints), but commonly drifts into
        narrative repair (“you’re overreacting / you misunderstood”) without interface change (Σ absent).
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ is concrete interface repair: adjusting delegation boundaries, disclosure norms, checkpoints, or
        responsibility allocations so trust remains viable under real Ω/Θ. Without Σ, trust is sustained by
        rhetoric and becomes brittle.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ stabilizes trust only as self-binding (Ψ→Self): owned follow-through and repair commitments across Θ.
        Drift: Ψ externalized (Ψ→Other: “you must trust me”) or misbound to appearance-management (looking aligned).
      distance_chi: >
        Χ is the revision/verification window: pausing, checking, clarifying without humiliation or verdict.
        In drift, Χ becomes socially expensive and is treated as betrayal or aggression.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signatures are shorthand. Canonical PMS prerequisites remain authoritative:
      Χ presupposes Φ/Θ/□; Σ presupposes Χ/Φ; Ψ presupposes Σ/Θ/Χ.

  addon_lens:
    active_signatures:
      - signature_id: "meta_signature_self_control_over_other_control"
        title: "Meta-signature: self-control > other-control"
        formula: "META = (Ψ ∘ Χ) applied to Ω-handling (D constraint) > Ψ→Other demands with substitutes."
        how_it_applies_here: >
          A trust regime stays viable when revision/verification (Χ) and self-bound follow-through (Ψ→Self)
          remain real under Ω. “Trust me” that functions as Ψ→Other is a drift marker.
      - signature_id: "reciprocity_loss_signature"
        title: "Reciprocity loss — reduced"
        formula: "RECIPROCITY_LOSS = Θ-erosion of Σ/Ψ-carried coordination under real Ω with chronic Λ and stabilized Α."
        how_it_applies_here: >
          If trust rhetoric replaces Σ repair and Ψ→Self ownership, Λ remains chronic and scripts stabilize (Α).
          Under Θ, reciprocity erodes: cooperation becomes maintenance and monitoring instead of shared coordination.
      - signature_id: "PS_core_signature"
        title: "Pseudo-Symmetry (PS) — core"
        formula: "PS = [□comparison + Ω real] with Σ blocked/simulated and Ψ misbound to appearance-management."
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Trust drift often couples to pseudo-symmetry: parity talk (“we’re aligned / we both do our part”)
          substitutes for explicit Ω coordination, while trust questions are punished as relational threat.
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "P-Λ-DN"
        label: "Λ → Denial / Suppression (“Nothing happened”)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Missing disclosure or missing follow-through is minimized to preserve speed and harmony; residue remains
          active and returns across Θ.
      - drift_id: "P-Ψ-EXT"
        label: "Ψ → Externalization (“You must…”)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          “Trust” is used to impose obligation on the other (stop questioning, accept defaults) instead of adopting
          self-bound follow-through and repair commitments (Ψ→Self).
      - drift_id: "PS"
        label: "Pseudo-Symmetry"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Parity talk replaces gradient coordination: Ω remains real, but “trust” enforces silence about it; Σ is
          not allowed to form; Ψ binds to appearance of alignment.
      - drift_id: "chapter_11_reciprocity_loss"
        label: "RECIPROCITY_LOSS"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Chronic Λ plus priced Χ and suppressed Σ/Ψ under real Ω yields an erosion trajectory across Θ: trust becomes
          a battleground (standing/loyalty) rather than a coordination regime.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      EDEN makes explicit how “trust” can drift from coordination credit to tribunal/standing logic:
      trust becomes a loyalty test that suppresses Ω speakability and prices Χ, while Σ is bypassed and Ψ is
      externalized or misbound. This keeps the analysis structural (regime mechanics) and blocks psychologizing
      or moral verdicts.

  drift_classification:
    drift_present: true
    drift_label: "Trust-as-demand / trust-as-standing (□ drift; Χ priced; Σ bypassed; Ψ externalized)"
    minimal_drift_signature: >
      Δ + □(praxis→value-relation) + Λ chronic + Ω salient + Θ accumulation
      with Χ priced, Σ low/simulated, and Ψ externalized/misbound; Α stabilizes loyalty/avoidance scripts.
    observable_markers:
      - "Verification/clarification is punished as betrayal; Χ is socially priced."
      - "“Trust” is invoked to block questions rather than to enable coordination repair."
      - "Missing follow-through or missing transparency persists as Λ without conversion into Σ."
      - "Commitments are implied but not self-owned; obligations are imposed (Ψ→Other)."
      - "Parity/loyalty signaling substitutes for gradient coordination (PS adjacency)."

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Higher-exposure roles (R1) bear most downstream cost when trust defaults fail (cleanup, risk, reputational
      exposure). Lower-exposure roles (R2) may gain speed/discretion and incur fewer immediate costs, enabling
      asymmetric pricing of “trust.” Audiences/institutions (R3) can amplify standing logic at low direct cost.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Repeated unresolved residues harden into trajectories: each cycle where checks are skipped and repair is
      deferred reduces reversibility and increases repair cost. Later “trust repair” has weaker effect once scripts
      (Α) and narratives (Φ) stabilize under Θ.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Λ accumulates as open account (“not clarified,” “not disclosed,” “not followed through”). Under □ drift, Λ
      becomes leverage/tribunal surface and is treated as evidence of disloyalty or defect rather than as a repair
      target convertible into Σ.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Reducing verification to avoid conflict and preserve short-term coordination speed."
      - "Invoking trust language to lower friction when Σ-work is costly or punished."
      - "Using Φ narrative repair to maintain face when concrete interface changes (Σ) are expensive."
      - "Withdrawing effort or increasing private monitoring when Ω exposure becomes too costly under Θ."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Trust rhetoric becomes a shaming tool: questions are framed as disrespect or betrayal, and loyalty tests
      substitute for coordination. This degrades standing and prices the revision window (Χ).
    structural_indicator: >
      Rising intolerance for Χ (pause/verify/clarify), persistence of Λ without Σ conversion, and binding shifts
      toward Ψ→Other demands or appearance-management rather than Ψ→Self ownership under Ω.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "A diagnosis of 'trust issues' or any psychological state."
      - "A global claim that a person is 'trustworthy' or 'untrustworthy.'"
      - "A moral verdict about skepticism or verification."
      - "That missing follow-through is always intentional."
    claimed:
      - "Trust is structurally a relational regime: a □-framed default that reallocates verification costs and expectations (Λ) under Ω/Θ."
      - "Trust remains viable only when Χ (revisability), Σ (interface repair), and Ψ→Self (owned follow-through) remain accessible."
      - "When □ drifts into loyalty/standing, trust rhetoric tends to price Χ, bypass Σ, externalize Ψ, and retain Λ—predicting erosion under Θ."
    misuse_warning: >
      High misuse risk if translated into person labels (“you are untrustworthy”), coercive obligation demands
      (“you must trust me”), or humiliation. Keep all readings scene-bound, revisable, and dignity-constrained;
      treat Ω as functional gradients and target Σ/Ψ/Χ accessibility, not persons.

  structural_closure: >
    Trust, in PMS–EDEN, is not an inner feeling but a relational coordination regime: a □-framed default that
    reduces monitoring by treating certain checks as not-required (Λ) while relying on stabilized reliability
    scripts (Α) under real exposure gradients (Ω) across time (Θ). Trust remains structurally viable only when
    revision and verification remain permitted (Χ), concrete interface repair can occur (Σ), and follow-through
    is owned as self-binding (Ψ→Self). Drift occurs when □ shifts from praxis-relation to value-relation and
    “trust” becomes standing/loyalty language: Χ is priced, Σ is bypassed or simulated, Ψ is externalized (Ψ→Other)
    or misbound to appearance-management, and Λ is retained as residue/leverage—yielding reciprocity erosion under Θ.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Trust here is not a personality trait; it’s a coordination setup. It lets people skip some checking because
    they expect follow-through and repair if something goes wrong. But trust breaks structurally when “trust me”
    becomes a loyalty demand that punishes questions. If missed follow-through keeps happening and nothing changes,
    the missing pieces pile up over time and cooperation erodes.
