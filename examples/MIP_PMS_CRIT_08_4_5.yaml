      - case_label: privacy_vs_publicness
      - title: Privacy vs. Publicness
      - overlay: CRITIQUE
      - core motifs: critique shifts from private to public; publicness amplifies Ω/Θ/Α without adding corrective capacity; privacy can preserve Χ/Σ but limits reach/uptake; boundary shifts become sites of authority laundering or exposure-as-substitute; under P, Χ is priced and Σ/Ψ are endangered.
      This MIPractice file is a template-level re-reading of the PMS material using ACRPD + IA box (T/J/TB/R),
      with the AH precision overlay enabled (storage-only; no new base inference layer).
    secondary_material: ""
    assumptions_and_inferences: |
      - Pattern-level structural reading only (no concrete vignette, identifiable persons, or platform specified).
      - “Privacy” and “publicness” are treated descriptively as frame regimes that change interruption (Χ), exposure (Ω), and irreversibility (Θ), not as moral values.
      - The main IA risk corridor is exposure substituting for correction: escalation to public visibility increases costs and hardening while reducing actionable repair (Σ) and owned follow-up (Ψ).
      - Responsibility allocation (M) is leverage-dependent: higher where actors control channels, boundary norms, record persistence, and amplification; lower where actors face dependency, high retaliation risk, or low alternatives.
    quality_and_limits:
      coverage_estimate: "medium"
      reliability_estimate: "medium"
      known_gaps:
        - "No concrete vignette/data; scenario remains template-level."
        - "No specified embedding (team/org/platform/media) and no explicit decision gates for escalation."
        - "No explicit consent/confidentiality agreement terms or boundary-setting protocol."
        - "No explicit remediation path: correction propagation, right-of-reply, takedown, or revision handling."
        - "No explicit publicity level; P is treated as a variable overlay without concrete parameterization."
      main_bias_risks_here:
        - "abstraction_bias (overfitting the template to too-many real cases)"
        - "availability_bias (salient public cases over-weighted)"

  snapshot:
    short_case_description: |
      A practice pattern where critique moves from a private/bounded setting into a public or semi-public context.
      The key issue is structural: shifting frames changes interruptibility (Χ), exposure gradients (Ω), and irreversibility (Θ),
      and can enable drift where visibility functions as substitute for correction (Σ) and owned follow-up (Ψ).

      - "R1_raiser"
      - "R2_target"
      - "R3_audience_amplifiers"
      - "R4_platform_records_optional"
    guiding_question: |
      How can privacy/publicness transitions be handled so that interruption and correction remain viable (Χ/Σ),
      time-costs and irreversibility are bounded (Θ), and follow-up responsibility is owned (Ψ),
      rather than converting visibility into sanction-like pressure under Ω and P?

    publicity_degree: "variable"

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: |
      - Structural distinction: private vs public frames are different regimes for interruption, revision, and exposure pricing.
      - Entry constraint: interruption/refusal (Χ) must remain practically possible; otherwise escalation becomes coercive by default.
      - Protected good: actionable correction (Σ) and owned follow-up (Ψ) rather than exposure-as-substitute.
      - Drift boundary: publicness (P) steepens Ω and accelerates Θ hardening without adding corrective capacity; visibility must not be treated as proof or authority.
    variable_elements: |
      - Embedding: dyad/team/internal channel vs institutional process vs media-amplified publics.
      - Boundary norms: explicit confidentiality terms vs implicit expectations.
      - Channel design: moderation, right-of-reply, documentation rules, record persistence, screenshot culture.
      - Escalation gates: when private repair is attempted, when escalation is allowed, and how reasons are documented.
      - Remediation design: correction propagation, revision handling, takedown or update mechanisms.
      - Participation: whether affected parties can respond, opt out, or influence scope and framing.
    unfair_high_M_zones: |
      - Where targets face extreme public exposure and low ability to correct narratives, assigning high M for “not responding well” is unfair.
      - Where raisers face high retaliation risk and private channels are blocked, assigning high M for “not keeping it private” is unfair.
      - Where platforms and audiences create permanence and amplification, individual M of targets/raisers is capped; designer/institutional M rises.
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: |
      - “Transparency requires this” used to justify exposure while bypassing repair and responsibility.
      - “It’s public now” used to deny revision, correction propagation, or scope correction.
      - “Everyone saw it” used as pseudo-legitimation of pile-on dynamics and Ψ diffusion.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: |
        Actors often recognize that moving to public changes stakes, but may underestimate how strongly P steepens Ω and accelerates Θ hardening.
        Receivers/targets may sense exposure costs earlier than raisers and audiences acknowledge.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: |
        Escalation talk appears (“we have to go public”); boundary expectations remain implicit; screenshots/records circulate;
        pause or clarification is reframed as evasion; repair attempts become performative rather than actionable.
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: |
        Confusing visibility with correction; treating public exposure as “accountability” while Σ/Ψ are unowned;
        underestimating how audiences stabilize Α scripts and diffuse Ψ; ignoring that reversal is harder once P is active.
    coherence:
      official_narratives: |
        “We need transparency.” “People must know.” “If it’s true, it can be public.”
        “Going public is the only way to get accountability.” “Silence means guilt.”
      visible_enactments: |
        Private channels are bypassed or declared ineffective; content is replayed publicly; audiences align or pile-on;
        boundaries shift without explicit consent; records persist and recirculate; actionability decreases as exposure rises.
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: |
        Coherence breaks when “repair” is claimed while exposure substitutes for correction,
        when “confidentiality” is assumed but violated, or when “accountability” means reputational punishment without Σ/Ψ design.
    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: |
        - Make boundary terms explicit: what may move across frames and under which conditions.
        - Keep Χ real: protect pause/clarification/refusal without reputational penalty, especially under P.
        - Prefer Σ over exposure: define actionable correction steps before escalating visibility.
        - Own follow-up (Ψ): assign who updates records, corrects narratives, and propagates revisions.
        - Allocate responsibility by leverage: higher where actors control channels, amplification, permanence, and moderation rules.
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: |
        Responsibility shifts into “visibility logic”: “we’re just sharing” while exposure functions like sanction.
        Ownership diffuses into audience dynamics: “everyone knows” replaces who is responsible for repair.
        Platforms externalize: persistence is treated as neutral while it materially shapes Θ and irreversibility.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: |
        Targets may face durable reputational harm and reduced correction capacity; raisers may face retaliation or moralization.
        Third parties learn that publicity can function as governance substitute, normalizing exposure-as-correction patterns.
    power:
      formal_power_distribution: |
        Template-level: formal power varies by embedding; publicness introduces informal power via attention, amplification, and reputational pricing.
      factual_power_distribution: |
        P steepens Ω: audiences and platforms can impose large costs at low exposure to themselves; Θ hardening increases via persistence and replay.
      used_alternatives: |
        - Escalation to public to force acknowledgment or closure.
        - Audience alignment as de facto sanction mechanism.
        - Record circulation (screenshots, archives) to stabilize narrative under Θ.
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: |
        - Explicit confidentiality/consent terms and escalation gates.
        - Protected right-of-reply and correction propagation (Σ scaffolding).
        - Time-bounded pilots or mediated processes before broad publication.
        - Clear separation between reporting, critique, and sanction-like pressure.
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: |
        D module remains OFF. Dignity risk is handled structurally: key risk is degradation via exposure-as-punishment and shame frames
        (“silence means guilt”) that price interruption (Χ) under steep Ω in public contexts.

  ia_protection:
    transparency_measures: |
      - Specify boundary terms: what is confidential, what can be shared, and escalation conditions.
      - Differentiate reporting vs critique vs sanction-like dynamics; avoid treating visibility as proof.
      - Document the goal: repair (Σ) vs warning/protection; state which is intended.
      - Make record persistence explicit (screenshots, archives, retention) and its implications for Θ.
    time_bound_measures: |
      - Use staged escalation with review windows (private attempt → mediated process → limited disclosure → broader public only if needed).
      - Set sunset rules for pinned/replayed materials where possible; require periodic reconsideration of continued visibility.
      - Trigger review when pile-on dynamics or refusal pricing becomes visible (Α/Χ markers).
    reversibility_measures: |
      - Ensure right-of-reply and correction propagation (updates travel with the original claim where feasible).
      - Provide takedown/update mechanisms and clear procedures for revisions, apologies, or scope corrections.
      - Protect interruption (Χ): allow pause/clarification without reputational punishment; limit audience sanction dynamics.

  trajectory:
    key_timepoints:
      - label: "t0"
        short_description: "Critique arises in a private/bounded frame; repair is possible if interruption (Χ) and actionable correction (Σ) are available."
        A_band_at_t: "A ≈ 5–7/10"
        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 2–7/10 (rises with channel control and boundary-setting leverage)"
      - label: "t1"
        short_description: "Private uptake fails or boundaries remain implicit (Λ); escalation pressure grows; records begin to circulate; audience scripts (Α) start to form."
        A_band_at_t: "A ≈ 4–6/10"
        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 3–8/10 (amplifiers/platform leverage becomes decisive)"
      - label: "t2"
        short_description: "Publicness (P) active: Ω steepens and Θ hardening accelerates; pause/refusal is priced (Χ); repair becomes symbolic; follow-up ownership diffuses (Ψ)."
        A_band_at_t: "A ≈ 4–6/10 (depends on safeguards)"
        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 4–8/10 (highest where actors institutionalize amplification without repair design)"
    course_in_words: |
      The pattern often starts as a private repair attempt or bounded concern.
      When private uptake fails or boundaries are unclear, escalation becomes attractive as a closure mechanism.
      Once publicness is active, exposure and irreversibility rise quickly while actionable correction and owned follow-up become harder unless explicitly scaffolded.
    responsibility_viability_range: |
      Viability is highest when escalation is staged, boundary terms are explicit, interruption is protected, and correction propagation is designed.
      Viability collapses when visibility is treated as correction or authority and when publics diffuse ownership while pricing refusal.

  open_questions_and_blind_spots:
    unclear_points: |
      - What is the concrete embedding (team/org/platform/media), and what escalation gates exist?
      - What are the explicit confidentiality terms and consent mechanics (if any)?
      - What is the concrete publicity degree, and how does it change Ω, Θ persistence, and refusal pricing (Χ)?
      - What remediation paths exist (right-of-reply, takedown/update, correction propagation)?
      - Who owns follow-up (Ψ) and how are revisions handled across records?
    missing_data_or_perspectives: |
      - A concrete vignette showing the private phase, the escalation trigger, and how records circulated.
      - The target’s perspective on correction capacity and refusal costs under publicness.
      - The raiser’s perspective on why private channels were blocked and what repair was attempted.
      - Platform/moderation perspective on persistence, reach, and update mechanics.
    distortion_risks: |
      - Overgeneralizing: treating all public escalation as illegitimate rather than differentiating protection/reporting from exposure-as-sanction drift.
      - Availability and outrage bias: salience of high-exposure cases inflating perceived inevitability of pile-ons.
      - Moralization drift: reading incentive-stabilized scripts as intent or character rather than as structural dynamics.

  biases_case_level:
    initial_intuition: |
      Public escalation often functions as a closure device: it increases pressure and irreversibility quickly, while repair capacity drops.
      The drift marker is when “transparency” language replaces actionability and responsibility ownership.
    named_bias_risks:
      - "availability_bias"
      - "hindsight_bias"
      - "in_group_bias"
      - "status_quo_bias"
      - "confirmation_bias"
    counter_reading_outline: |
      Counter-reading: In some settings, going public is the only viable protective mechanism because private channels are captured or unsafe.
      Public visibility may be necessary for accountability, warning, or prevention. A safe application must test whether private repair was blocked,
      whether escalation is scoped and time-bounded, whether right-of-reply and correction propagation exist, and whether amplification is moderated to prevent exposure-as-sanction drift.

  analyst_reflection:
    self_implication_notes: |
      Structural descriptions of privacy/publicness can be misheard as prescribing secrecy or condemning disclosure.
      This reading therefore stays descriptive: it maps how P changes Ω/Θ/Χ and what design variables preserve Σ/Ψ without authorizing exposure.
    possible_next_steps: |
      - Add one concrete vignette and map: boundary terms, escalation trigger, record persistence, and revision events.
      - Add explicit if/then gates for escalation (private attempt required? safety exception? documentation of reasons?).
      - Add correction propagation and update/takedown procedures to increase practical reversibility (R) under Θ.
      - Add moderation/participation rules to reduce audience-driven Ψ diffusion and Χ pricing under P.

    title: "Praxeological analysis of a practice pattern: Private-to-public critique transition"
    one_paragraph_overview: |
      This reading treats “privacy vs publicness” as a structural shift between two different regimes for handling critique.
      Private frames typically preserve the ability to pause, clarify, and repair, while public frames increase exposure and make revisions harder because records persist and audiences amplify scripts.
      The question is not whether publicity is morally right or wrong, but whether visibility is being used as substitute for actionable correction and owned follow-up.
      Over time, escalation can harden narratives and price refusal, especially when public attention increases while correction pathways remain weak.
      The analysis therefore centers boundary governance: explicit terms, staged escalation, protected interruption, and correction propagation when information changes.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Risk mechanism: publicness (P) steepens Ω and accelerates Θ hardening (records/replay), stabilizing audience scripts (Α) while pricing interruption (Χ)."
      - "IA risk rises when visibility substitutes for correction: actionable repair (Σ) and owned follow-up (Ψ) are bypassed or diffused."
      - "Responsibility is leverage-dependent: highest where actors control channels, amplification, permanence, and moderation; capped where actors face dependency or low correction capacity."
      - "Safer transitions use explicit boundary terms, staged escalation gates, protected right-of-reply, and correction propagation to preserve reversibility."
    maturity_summary: |
      In terms of maturity in practice, the pattern supports adult enactment when boundary terms are explicit, interruption is protected, and escalation is tied to actionable correction rather than to reputational pressure.
    ia_box_summary: |
      Structurally, IA risk increases when the shift to publicness is not transparent about boundary rules, not justified by repair design and symmetric participation, not time-bounded by review/update norms, and not practically reversible once records persist.
    dignity_summary: ""
    trajectory_summary: |
      Over time, the case often moves from potentially repairable private critique to public escalation where irreversibility rises and repair becomes harder unless safeguards are explicitly built in.
    open_questions_summary: |
      Important open questions are the concrete embedding and publicity degree, the confidentiality/consent terms, the remediation and update mechanics, and who owns follow-up responsibility across records.
    conclusion: |
      The model suggests using this case to prevent exposure from becoming a substitute for correction: clarify boundaries, stage escalation, protect interruption, and design correction propagation.
      Where public amplification steepens costs, additional safeguards are needed so accountability does not collapse into sanction-like pressure without owned repair.
