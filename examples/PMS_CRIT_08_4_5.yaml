        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can represent framing (□), asymmetry (Ω), temporality (Θ),
          non-events (Λ), attractor stabilization (Α), distance (Χ), integration (Σ),
          and self-binding (Ψ). However, it does not explicitly formalize the
          critique-specific tension where privacy and publicness function as
          competing structural regimes: (i) publicness amplifies Ω/Θ/Α without
          adding corrective capacity, (ii) privacy can preserve Χ and Σ but
          suppress reach and uptake, and (iii) shifts between private and public
          frames become sites of authority laundering or exposure-as-substitute.
          The CRITIQUE overlay supplies a publicness overlay (P), reach discipline,
          and drift typology to keep privacy/publicness transitions descriptive,
          bounded, and non-authorizing.

  scene_packet:

    context: >
      A critique or concern originates in a private or bounded setting
      (dyadic, team, internal channel) and is later raised, referenced,
      or replayed in a public or semi-public context. The core issue is
      not secrecy versus transparency as values, but how shifting frames
      change interruptibility, exposure, and correction viability.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Structural legibility of privacy vs. publicness as frame regimes:
        how moving an issue across visibility boundaries alters Ω, Θ, Χ,
        and the availability of Σ and Ψ.
      protected_constraints:
        - "Scene-bound claims only; no global exposure logic."
        - "Distance (Χ) must remain practical in both private and public frames."
        - "Dignity-in-practice (D) constrains exposure under asymmetry."
        - "Publicness does not add authority or truth-status."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Moral valuation of secrecy or transparency."
        - "Legal privacy or publicity doctrine."
        - "Psychological motives for disclosure or silence."
        - "Sanction or enforcement design."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "Short-to-long (episodes with durable residue)"
      iteration_rhythm: "Often episodic, with replay and citation cycles"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "Records, screenshots, archives"
        - "Narrative repetition in publics"
        - "Institutional memory"
      reversibility_window: >
        Narrowing sharply once publicness (P) is active; revisions cannot
        fully retract residue.

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      A mismatch exists between behavior/outcome and expectations, and
      between the need for correction and the available private channels.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Pressure to escalate visibility for acknowledgment, protection, or
      closure, often under time pressure or perceived blockage.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "Private uptake or correction does not occur"
      - "Boundaries of confidentiality are not clarified"
      - "Revision rights are not explicitly protected"

  operator_mapping:
    operator_chain: ["Ω", "Θ", "Α", "Λ", "□", "Χ", "Σ", "Ψ"]
    reduced_signature: >
      □(private) → Λ → escalation → □(public) + Ω/Θ amplified (P);
      Χ priced; Σ/Ψ endangered
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        Private and public frames allocate different rights to interrupt,
        refuse, revise, and expose.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Publicness steepens exposure gradients without redistributing
        correction capacity.
      theta_temporality: >
        Public records harden irreversibility; time favors scripts over repair.
      lambda_residue: >
        Missing private uptake accumulates and later functions as justification
        for public escalation.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Scripts such as pile-on, silence, or performative alignment stabilize.
      recontext_phi: >
        Movement from private to public reframes the issue as visibility-worthy,
        often substituting exposure for correction.
      integration_sigma: >
        Actionable correction becomes costly or symbolic under P.
      binding_psi: >
        Follow-up ownership diffuses or is externalized once public.
      distance_chi: >
        Stop-capability collapses when visibility penalizes pause or refusal.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Publicness (P) is an overlay, not an operator. Treating visibility as
      correction or binding violates PMS dependency discipline.

    not_claimed:
      - "That privacy is inherently good or publicness inherently bad"
      - "That escalation is justified or unjustified"
      - "That motives are known"
    claimed:
      - "Privacy and publicness are distinct structural regimes"
      - "Publicness amplifies Ω/Θ/Α without adding correction capacity"
      - "Safe critique requires preserving Χ, Σ, and Ψ across frames"
    misuse_warning: >
      High misuse risk if visibility is treated as authority or sanction.

  structural_closure: >
    Privacy vs. publicness names a structural trade-off: private frames
    preserve interruptibility and correction capacity, while public frames
    amplify exposure and irreversibility. PMS–CRITIQUE closes the case by
    treating publicness as an overlay (P), not as proof, authority, or
    correction.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Some problems can be addressed privately, others end up in public.
    The difference matters structurally: going public makes things visible
    but also harder to pause, fix, or take responsibility for. This case
    explains that tension without judging whether publicity is right or
    wrong—it shows how visibility changes the risks, the time horizon,
    and who can actually do something about the problem.
