        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can model framed justification routines and stabilized belief integration,
          but it does not by itself formalize the LOGIC-level misalignment between justification,
          truth, and closure. The LOGIC overlay makes visible the warrant-gap boundary (Λ) and
          the characteristic drift risks where local success/coherence (Σ) is laundered into
          epistemic authority (e.g., Σ-totalization and Ω-inflation).

    context: >
      Knowledge attribution in epistemic practices (everyday reasoning, testimony, institutional
      validation) where a belief is true and justified by accepted standards, yet truth is achieved
      through accidental alignment rather than a robust connection.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Epistemic evaluation inside a declared justification regime: admissible evidence, inference
        norms, and testimonial standards (□). The regime determines what counts as a good reason,
        and what strength of claim is licensed.
      protected_constraints:
        - "Justification is frame-bound (□), not frame-independent warrant."
        - "Operational success/coherence does not imply epistemic necessity."
        - "Non-closure (Λ) regarding truth-connection is admissible and must be carried."
        - "Distance (Χ) blocks retroactive authority laundering from success."
        - "Reversibility: attribution remains revisable under recontextualization (Φ)."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Redefinition of truth as mere coherence or success."
        - "Psychological accounts of belief states, intentions, or virtues."
        - "Moral evaluation of epistemic agents."
        - "Prescriptive 'ought' claims about belief or testimony."

    temporality:
      time_scale: "Short-run belief formation with delayed truth-assessment and later revision cycles."
      iteration_rhythm: "Form belief → attribute knowledge → encounter counterexample/anomaly → reframe/update."
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "Institutional standards for justification and credentialed evaluation."
        - "Habituation of inference routines and testimonial trust patterns (Α-stabilization)."
        - "Downstream reliance and infrastructural embedding of 'known' claims."
      reversibility_window: >
        Revision remains possible while the justification frame (□) is open to Φ-updates; closure hardens
        when Σ is treated as final and the attribution is institutionalized.

    roles:
      - role_label: "R1_belief_holder"
        function: "Integrates reasons/evidence into a belief (Σ) within a justification frame (□)."
        exposure_profile: "Exposure to misattribution increases when truth happens accidentally and is later discovered."
        notes: "Structural role only; no person evaluation implied."
      - role_label: "R2_evaluator_attributor"
        function: "Assigns 'knowledge' status and manages epistemic labels within the frame (□)."
        exposure_profile: "Authority varies; can impose durable attributions (Ω gradients)."
        notes: "Includes peers, experts, institutions, platforms."
      - role_label: "R3_rule_or_institution"
        function: "Stabilizes justification criteria across time (Α), often independent of case-level anomalies."
        exposure_profile: "Can externalize epistemic risk to downstream users through authoritative labels."
        notes: "Structural persistence mechanism, not an agent claim."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Difference between (i) justified belief that meets frame criteria and (ii) non-accidental truth-connection
      (robust linkage between the justificatory route and the fact that makes the belief true).
    nabla_impulse: >
      Pressure to close the gap: the drive to treat 'true + justified' as sufficient for epistemic closure and to
      stabilize knowledge-attribution as authoritative.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "No non-accidental linking event appears between the justificatory route and the truth-maker."
      - "No additional warrant event resolves the gap without ad hoc supplementation."
      - "The expected closure condition ('knowledge achieved') fails to materialize as a stable criterion."

    reduced_signature: "LOGIC_boundary_management + NON_CLOSURE_stability"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        Justification criteria are defined by □: admissible evidence, inference rules, and testimonial standards.
        These criteria license attributions only within the declared scope.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Knowledge attribution can be asymmetric: evaluators/institutions may impose epistemic labels that are difficult
        to contest; risk and reliance distribute unevenly.
      theta_temporality: >
        Truth alignment is often assessed after stabilization; later discoveries can force revision. Temporal delay is
        constitutive of Gettier-style misalignment.
      lambda_residue: >
        The accidental element persists as Λ: the missing non-accidental connection is not delivered by the frame's
        own justification routines.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Justification practices stabilize as attractors: repeated successful attributions and social reinforcement
        can harden the regime despite recognized anomalies.
      recontext_phi: >
        Gettier cases function as recontextualization triggers: they force re-reading what justification can claim,
        potentially shifting frames or tightening scope.
      integration_sigma: >
        Reasons are coherently integrated into belief; the drift risk is treating this coherence as epistemic finality.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ is optional: appears when an institution self-binds to a regime (e.g., fixed credentialing, policy reliance,
        or methodological commitments) that persists across cases.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ enforces boundary discipline: it prevents retroactive conversion of 'being right' into authoritative warrant
        and keeps attribution revisable.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Any repair strategy that forces closure by redefining knowledge conditions risks bypassing Χ and Φ and pushing Σ
      into totalization. Reduced-signature references do not negate PMS prerequisites: Σ requires Χ/Φ; Χ requires Φ/Θ/□.

        formula: "□ ∘ Λ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Marks the discipline of ordering and integrating reasons while explicitly carrying the justification–truth
          gap as Λ; Χ prevents closure laundering from coherence.

        title: "Sustainable non-closure (boundary attractor) (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Δ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Captures how epistemic practice remains stable despite acknowledged non-closure: justification regimes can
          persist as attractors even when they cannot guarantee non-accidental truth-connection.
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "dogmatism_sigma_totalization"
        label: "Dogmatism (Σ-totalization)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          The closure drive pushes toward redefining knowledge until the gap disappears, treating coherence and success
          as final truth and denying Λ.
      - drift_id: "authority_capture_omega_inflation"
        label: "Authority capture (Ω-inflation)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Epistemic labels ('known', 'settled') can be enforced via institutional asymmetry, overriding acknowledged
          boundary limits and suppressing Χ.
      - drift_id: "technocratic_reduction_frame_overconstraint"
        label: "Technocratic reduction (□-overconstraint)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Regimes may overconstrain the frame such that only what is measurable/credentialed counts, treating the
          remaining mismatch as irrelevant rather than as Λ-residue.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      The LOGIC overlay formalizes Gettier phenomena as warrant-boundary failures of justification regimes rather than
      anomalies of belief psychology. It distinguishes stable integration (Σ) from epistemic authority and specifies
      drift classes that capture how closure pressure can convert successful attribution into unjustified finality.

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Institutions and evaluators can impose 'knowledge' labels with high authority; downstream users may bear the
      costs of misattribution (misleading reliance) more than the labeler.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Justification regimes persist across time even after limits are known; correction is delayed and becomes costly
      when attributions are embedded in policy, education, or infrastructure.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      The non-accidental link between justification and truth remains structurally absent; the gap continues to exert
      pressure toward closure and invites compensatory strategies.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Acknowledge Λ (the justification–truth gap) instead of redefining closure ad hoc."
      - "Keep knowledge attribution explicitly frame-bound (□) and scope-limited."
      - "Use Χ to resist authority laundering from accidental success."
      - "Allow Φ-driven revision of standards when Gettier-style anomalies recur."
      - "Treat Σ as provisional coordination of reasons, not as epistemic finality."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Knowledge attributions become tools of asymmetrical control (Ω), policing dissent or legitimizing decisions
      while boundary limits (Λ) are suppressed.
    structural_indicator: >
      Σ is treated as epistemic finality and Λ is denied; frame choices (□) become opaque and non-negotiable, and
      Χ (distance/stop-capability) is bypassed in the name of certainty.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "A new definition of knowledge that resolves Gettier cases."
      - "A psychological account of belief, intention, or epistemic virtue."
      - "A prescriptive rule for what one ought to believe or accept."
      - "A moral evaluation of epistemic agents."
    claimed:
      - "Gettier problems expose a structural non-closure (Λ) in justification regimes under explicit frames (□)."
      - "Coherence and successful integration (Σ) do not authorize epistemic necessity or final closure."
      - "LOGIC discipline carries Λ within □ using Χ to prevent Σ-totalization and authority laundering."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use this case to delegitimize persons, enforce epistemic hierarchy, or convert institutional labels into
      unquestionable authority. Do not treat Λ as a defect requiring coercive certainty.

  structural_closure: >
    Gettier problems are specified as a configuration in which frame-bound justification supports coherent belief
    integration (Σ) while the non-accidental connection to truth remains structururally absent (Λ). PMS–LOGIC closes
    the case by stabilizing practice around explicit boundary-carrying: keep attribution frame-bound (□), preserve
    revisability via Φ, and apply Χ to prevent Σ from becoming dogmatic closure or authority.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Gettier cases show that someone can have good reasons and still be right only by luck. That means our usual
    justification rules can work well in practice without guaranteeing a reliable link to truth in every case.
    PMS–LOGIC treats this as a real boundary: keep the gap visible, stay open to revision, and don’t turn being right
    into unquestionable authority.
