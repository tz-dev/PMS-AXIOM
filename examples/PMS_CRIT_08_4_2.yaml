        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can represent framing (□), recontextualization (Φ), distance (Χ),
          integration (Σ), asymmetry (Ω), and temporal stabilization (Θ). But PMS core
          alone does not explicitly formalize critique-specific drift where explanatory
          clarity, legibility, or interpretability is mistaken for corrective adequacy
          or reality alignment. The CRITIQUE overlay adds explicit reach discipline,
          drift classes (especially narrative reset and commentary drift), and
          guardrails that prevent interpretability from being converted into authority,
          closure, or exposure substitutes.

    context: >
      A critique configuration prioritizes making a situation interpretable,
      explainable, or narratively coherent. Explanations proliferate and gain
      acceptance, while the underlying practical reality remains unchanged.
      Interpretability becomes the endpoint, displacing correction, integration,
      or responsibility.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Structural distinction between explanation quality (interpretability)
        and practical adequacy (reality alignment): the analysis tracks how
        critique drifts when Φ is treated as sufficient without Σ/Ψ.
      protected_constraints:
        - "Interpretability is not treated as evidence of correctness or adequacy."
        - "Explanation must remain interruptible (Χ) and revisable."
        - "No conversion of narrative clarity into authority or sanction."
        - "Dignity-in-practice constrains explanatory exposure under Ω."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Truth adjudication or empirical validation."
        - "Attribution of deception, ignorance, or bad faith."
        - "Psychological explanation of why actors prefer narratives."
        - "Prescriptive methods for fixing interpretability gaps."

    temporality:
      time_scale: "short-to-mid (meetings, review cycles, public episodes)"
      iteration_rhythm: "repeated explanation rounds without consolidation"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "documents, reports, dashboards"
        - "shared narratives and post-hoc rationales"
        - "institutional memory of explanations"
      reversibility_window: >
        Often formally open but practically ineffective: explanations can be
        revised, yet revision does not alter downstream consequences.

        exposure_profile: "bears consequences of unchanged reality"

        function: "Audience / evaluators"
        exposure_profile: "consume narratives; low accountability for outcomes"
        notes: "can stabilize interpretability as success criterion"

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      A gap appears between lived outcomes and their explanations:
      actions make sense narratively, but do not resolve the practical mismatch.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Pressure to explain, justify, or make legible replaces pressure to change
      or integrate; clarity becomes the demanded closure.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "No consolidatable corrective step follows explanation."
      - "No follow-up ownership is established."
      - "No interruption of the explanatory loop occurs."

    reduced_signature: "Δ ∘ □ ∘ Φ (inflated) ∘ Χ (formal) ∘ Σ absent ∘ Ψ absent"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        The frame privileges sense-making and coherence over outcome change;
        explanation quality becomes the relevance criterion.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Those producing explanations often bear less exposure than those
        affected by unchanged conditions.
      theta_temporality: >
        Over time, explanations accumulate and harden into official narratives,
        even as practical effects persist.
      lambda_residue: >
        Missing corrections and missing follow-up accumulate as background
        non-events, normalizing inaction.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Repeated explanation cycles stabilize as the default handling script.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ is overused: reframing and interpretation proliferate without bridging
        toward actionable consolidation.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ remains absent or symbolic; no coordinatable corrective unit emerges.
      binding_psi: >
        Responsibility for outcomes is not bound; narrative ownership replaces
        trajectory ownership.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ exists formally (discussion, review), but does not interrupt the
        explanatory attractor.

    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Interpretability without Σ is not partial integration. Treating Φ as
      sufficient violates PMS dependency order and indicates critique drift.

        formula: "Δ + □ + Χ + Φ + Σ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          The case highlights the failure point: Φ is present, but Σ does not
          consolidate correction, so productivity is not reached.

        label: "Commentary Drift"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Meta-analysis and interpretation stabilize while action remains suspended.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      The overlay names the specific critique failure where sense-making is
      mistaken for adequacy, preventing interpretability from being laundered
      into authority.

      - "Calls for correction are redirected into further analysis."

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Explanatory actors gain legitimacy with low risk; affected actors bear
      ongoing costs without leverage.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Over time, narratives harden and crowd out alternative framings.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Persistent non-correction becomes normalized background.

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Using explanation to invalidate lived impact or to silence further critique.
    structural_indicator: >
      D collapses when narrative coherence is used to dismiss ongoing harm.
    validity_reminder: >
      If explanation is used to shame, rank, or dismiss affected parties, the
      PMS entry condition is violated.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "That explanations are false or deceptive."
      - "That any actor intends to avoid correction."
      - "That interpretability is inherently bad."
    claimed:
      - "Interpretability and reality alignment are structurally distinct."
      - "Φ without Σ/Ψ produces critique drift."
      - "Narrative clarity can stabilize inaction."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use this case to delegitimize explanation as such, or to assert
      hidden motives. It diagnoses a structural configuration, not sincerity.

  structural_closure: >
    Interpretability vs. reality names a critique failure mode where explanatory
    coherence substitutes for correction. PMS–CRITIQUE closes the case by
    distinguishing sense-making (Φ) from integration and binding (Σ/Ψ), keeping
    critique descriptive and preventing narrative authority laundering.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Sometimes a situation is explained so well that it feels resolved, even
    though nothing actually changes. This case shows how clear explanations can
    replace real correction, especially when no one is responsible for follow-up.
    The point is not that explanations are wrong, but that understanding alone
    does not fix reality.
