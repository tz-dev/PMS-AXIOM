      - overlay: CRITIQUE
      - core motifs: critique-uptake failure under Ω/□; missing uptake and intelligibility repair (Λ) stabilizing into scripts (Α) under Θ hardening;

    secondary_material: ""
    assumptions_and_inferences: |
      - Pattern-level structural reading only (no concrete vignette, identifiable persons, or institution specified).
      - “Epistemic injustice” is treated as a regime risk: critique-uptake conditions are misallocated, so claims cannot reliably enter Σ correction pathways.
      - IA box is used as a legitimacy screen for drift into evaluation/authority laundering (evaluation tokens replace correction and follow-up).
      - Responsibility allocation (M) is leverage-dependent: higher where actors control frames, evidence standards, decision gates, documentation, and interruption pricing; lower for speakers with low alternatives.
    quality_and_limits:
      coverage_estimate: "medium"
      reliability_estimate: "medium"
      known_gaps:
        - "No concrete vignette/data; scenario remains template-level."
        - "No specified embedding (team/service/public/platform) and no explicit decision gates."
        - "No concrete evidence standards or dispute objects (what counts as ‘knowledge’ in this frame)."
        - "No explicit correction channel design (appeals, review windows, audit loop) beyond template suggestions."
        - "No stakeholder participation detail (who can contest the frame, and how revisions change outcomes)."
      main_bias_risks_here:
        - "abstraction_bias (overfitting the template to too-many real cases)"
        - "in_group_bias (assuming gate roles track ‘us’ credibility by default)"
        - "status_quo_bias (treating existing credibility allocations as natural/inevitable)"
        - "halo_effect (authority/eloquence treated as epistemic warrant)"
        - "hindsight_bias (reading stabilized scripts as intended rather than incentive-stabilized)"

  snapshot:
    short_case_description: |
      A practice pattern where a contribution cannot reliably enter shared reasoning and correction because credibility and intelligibility are role-allocated inside the active frame.
      Missing uptake and missing repair become durable non-events, stabilize into scripts, and harden over time; correction (Σ) and owned follow-up (Ψ) remain blocked.

      - "R4_records_institutional_memory_optional"
    guiding_question: |
      How can critique-uptake be made interruptible (Χ) and evidence-traceable inside the frame (□),
      so that contributions can travel into coordinatable correction (Σ) with owned follow-up (Ψ),
      rather than stabilizing as non-uptake scripts (Λ→Α) under Ω/Θ?

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: |
      - Structural distinction: disagreement about content ≠ systematic non-uptake as knowledge input.
      - Epistemic injustice here = misallocation of critique-uptake conditions under Ω within □ (credibility/intelligibility/interrupt rights).
      - Persistent Λ (missing uptake/repair) can harden under Θ into Α scripts that block Σ correction and Ψ ownership.
      - High Ω contexts require extra care: pricing Χ can convert evaluation into domination without explicit intent.
    variable_elements: |
      - Embedding type: internal team cycle vs service setting vs platform/public episode.
      - Evidence regime: what counts as admissible, who sets standards, and how standards are applied.
      - Publicity and amplification: private vs institutional vs media-amplified contexts affecting Ω/Θ.
      - Artifact durability: tickets/minutes/records vs ephemeral talk; searchability and reuse.
      - Contestation design: whether Χ interruptions are protected or penalized; appeal paths.
      - Σ corridors: concrete mechanisms to translate claims into checks, revisions, experiments, or corrective steps.
      - Ψ ownership: explicit follow-up owner vs diffusion across committees/audiences.
    unfair_high_M_zones: |
      - Where decision gates are opaque and alternatives are blocked, assigning high M to speakers for “not being convincing enough” is structurally unfair.
      - Where frame control, documentation, and evidence standards are held by gate roles, M rises primarily at leverage holders, not at those bearing dismissal costs.
      - Where retaliation risk or reputational pricing suppresses Χ, individual M for “not interrupting” is capped.
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: |
      - “That’s not objective / not evidence” asserted without specifying standards or offering intelligibility repair (Λ used as cover).
      - “Process requires more proof” used to defer indefinitely without time bounds or review gates (TB collapse).
      - “It’s already documented” used as authority token while Σ correction remains absent and Ψ ownership diffuses.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: |
        Actors may notice a recurring gap between “being said” and “counting as knowledge,” but may misread it as mere disagreement or style conflict.
        Speakers often detect the persistence of non-uptake even when they increase documentation and clarity.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: |
        Repeated dismissal patterns; missing clarifying questions; “needs more proof” loops without criteria;
        contribution treated as subjective regardless of content; silence replacing explicit rejection; rising escalation fatigue.
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: |
        Confusing legitimacy of evaluation with legitimacy of non-uptake; treating role authority as epistemic warrant;
        losing track of the difference between translating a claim (Φ corrective) and deflecting it (Φ substitutive);
        diffusion of follow-up ownership (Ψ) interpreted as “no one is responsible.”
    coherence:
      official_narratives: |
        “That’s not reliable.” “We can’t act on that.” “That’s subjective.” “Bring real evidence.”
        “This isn’t the right channel.” “We already have the facts.” “Let’s move on.”
      visible_enactments: |
        Evaluation tokens replace uptake; clarifying repair missing; repeated deferrals;
        documentation used as proxy for closure; audience alignment/silence stabilizes the frame;
        episodic re-framing into tone/attitude/fit categories.
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: |
        Coherence breaks when “we take concerns seriously” is enacted as evaluation-only without Σ pathways,
        or when “there is an appeals process” exists formally but is priced, slow, or reputationally costly (Χ formal-only).
    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: |
        - Make uptake criteria explicit: name what counts as admissible, and apply standards symmetrically across roles.
        - Keep Χ real: protect interruption/clarification without reputational penalty, especially under Ω.
        - Require Σ corridors: translate claims into bounded checks or corrective steps rather than stopping at evaluation.
        - Bind Ψ follow-up ownership: assign owners, review windows, and accountability points for reconsideration.
        - Allocate responsibility by leverage: higher at criteria setters, gate roles, and documentation/resource controllers.
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: |
        Responsibility shifts from correction to evaluation: “we assessed it” replaces “we tested/changed something.”
        Follow-up diffuses across audiences or committees; speakers are tasked with endless translation and proof escalation.
        Refusal appears as silence-as-steering, tone-policing reframes, or perpetual deferral without time bounds.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: |
        Speakers lose coordination power and may self-silence; lived impact signals are discounted and remain unintegrated.
        Third parties learn that alignment beats correction, stabilizing future non-reporting and institutional cynicism.
    power:
      formal_power_distribution: |
        Template-level: varies by embedding; evaluators often control channels, standards, and meeting flow; records can institutionalize the dominant frame.
      factual_power_distribution: |
        Gate roles and audiences shape what counts and what is actionable; speakers bear consequences but often lack leverage to force Σ or Ψ.
      used_alternatives: |
        - Dismissal by evaluation tokens (“not credible,” “not objective”).
        - Reframing into style/attitude categories (Φ substitutive).
        - Documentation as authority proxy rather than as correction instrument.
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: |
        - Symmetric criteria statements and intelligibility repair protocols.
        - Protected interruption rights and explicit clarification steps (Χ safeguards).
        - Concrete tests/pilots/checks that convert claims into Σ actions.
        - Explicit follow-up ownership and review windows (Ψ), including appeal and audit loops.
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: |
        D module remains OFF. Dignity risk is handled structurally: the main risk is degrading speakers via non-uptake plus evaluative labeling,
        converting critique failure into person-level compression and pricing Χ under Ω.

  ia_protection:
    transparency_measures: |
      - Specify uptake criteria: what counts as admissible, how credibility is assessed, and how standards apply across roles.
      - Separate evaluation from correction: document when something is rejected vs when it is queued for a test/check.
      - Make decision gates explicit: who decides, on what basis, and how dissent/repair is handled.
      - Track non-uptake as data: record when clarifying repair was not offered and why.
    time_bound_measures: |
      - Set review windows for contested claims: time-bounded reconsideration rather than indefinite deferral.
      - Require checkpointing: if a claim is repeatedly dismissed, trigger a criteria review or independent audit step.
      - Use sunset rules for standing dismissals: prevent Θ hardening from converting non-uptake into permanent precedent.
    reversibility_measures: |
      - Provide protected appeal paths that do not price Χ (no retaliation or reputational penalty for requesting repair).
      - Build correction propagation: when criteria or evaluations change, update downstream records and decisions.
      - Offer low-cost Σ tests where possible (bounded pilots, audits, sampling checks) to avoid evaluation-only closure.

        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 4–8/10 (highest where gate roles institutionalize non-uptake without review)"
    course_in_words: |
      The pattern moves from an initial mismatch into repeated non-uptake where missing repair becomes residue and stabilizes into scripts.
      As records and precedent accumulate, Θ hardens the dominant frame, making later correction costly and making reversibility mostly formal.
      Where interruption rights and Σ tests are protected and follow-up ownership is assigned, the pattern can remain corrigible rather than becoming a stabilized injustice regime.
    responsibility_viability_range: |
      Viability is highest when uptake criteria are explicit, interruption is protected, and dismissal triggers bounded tests and review windows with explicit Ψ ownership.
      Viability collapses when silence/evaluation substitutes for correction and when artifact hardening converts non-uptake into precedent.

  open_questions_and_blind_spots:
    unclear_points: |
      - What is the concrete embedding (team/service/platform/public), and what decision gates exist?
      - What are the explicit evidence standards, and who sets them? Are they symmetric across roles?
      - How are records produced and reused (Θ), and how do they propagate into downstream decisions?
      - What correction channels exist (Σ), and who owns follow-up (Ψ)? Are interruption rights (Χ) protected?
    missing_data_or_perspectives: |
      - A concrete vignette showing the dismissal sequence, the repair attempts, and the downstream consequences.
      - Perspectives from speakers and gate roles about criteria, constraints, and retaliation risk (pricing Χ).
      - Evidence on whether appeals/revisions change outcomes or only update narratives in place (reversibility).
    distortion_risks: |
      - Overgeneralizing from the template to contexts where strict gatekeeping is legitimately required for safety/quality.
      - Moralization drift: treating the pattern as malicious intent rather than incentive-stabilized scripts.
      - Authority bias: treating institutional or eloquent narratives as epistemic warrant rather than as contested framing.

  biases_case_level:
    initial_intuition: |
      Epistemic injustice often stabilizes not through explicit conflict but through repeatable non-uptake and criteria opacity: “it never counts.”
      The key risk is that evaluation replaces correction and that records turn non-uptake into precedent.
    named_bias_risks:
      - "status_quo_bias"
      - "in_group_bias"
      - "halo_effect"
      - "confirmation_bias"
      - "hindsight_bias"
    counter_reading_outline: |
      Counter-reading: In some contexts, gatekeeping is a justified safety/quality function (e.g., evidentiary standards, risk control),
      and non-uptake may reflect real constraints rather than misallocation. A safe application must test symmetry of standards,
      availability of intelligibility repair, and existence of time-bounded review and Σ pathways before labeling the pattern as injustice.

  analyst_reflection:
    self_implication_notes: |
      Analytic framing can itself launder authority: “this is injustice” can be heard as a verdict rather than a structural mapping.
      This reading therefore keeps truth-adjudication out of scope and centers criteria symmetry, repair availability, and correction pathways.

      - Add one concrete vignette and map: channels, criteria, decision gates, records, and downstream consequences.
      - Specify a repair protocol: what clarifying questions must occur before dismissal is treated as final.
      - Define review windows and ownership so reversibility is practical, not merely formal.

    title: "Praxeological analysis of a practice pattern: Critique-uptake failure under asymmetric credibility allocation"
    one_paragraph_overview: |
      This reading treats “epistemic injustice” as a practice pattern where a contribution cannot reliably count as a candidate input to shared reasoning and correction.
      The problem is not whether a claim is true, but whether the situation’s criteria and channels allow clarification, symmetric evaluation, and a concrete check or corrective step.
      When missing uptake and missing repair repeat, they become the norm and stabilize into scripts, while records and precedent harden the dominant frame over time.
      Those who control criteria and gates can discount with low exposure, while speakers bear ongoing costs and may self-silence or over-document.
      The analysis keeps the unit structural and highlights safeguards that keep evaluation from substituting for correction and owned follow-up.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Risk mechanism: credibility and interruption rights are role-allocated under Ω within □, producing persistent non-uptake (Λ) that stabilizes into scripts (Α) and hardens under Θ."
      - "Evaluation tokens replace correction pathways: Σ tests/corrections and Ψ follow-up ownership remain blocked or diffused."
      - "Responsibility is leverage-dependent: highest at criteria setters, gate roles, and documentation/resource controllers; lower where alternatives are structurally blocked."
      - "IA risk rises when criteria are opaque, deferral is indefinite, and appeals are only formal (TB/R weak), especially once records turn non-uptake into precedent."
    maturity_summary: |
      In terms of maturity in practice, the pattern supports adult enactment when criteria are explicit and symmetric, repair is protected, and claims can move into bounded tests or corrections with owned follow-up, rather than being stopped at evaluation.
    ia_box_summary: |
      Structurally, IA risk rises when the asymmetry is not transparent, not justified by symmetric standards, not time-bounded by review windows, and not practically reversible through protected appeal and correction propagation.
    dignity_summary: ""
    trajectory_summary: |
      Over time, the constellation tends to drift from initial dismissal toward stabilized non-uptake scripts and artifact hardening unless interruption, repair, and correction corridors are explicitly designed.
    open_questions_summary: |
      Important open questions are the concrete embedding and decision gates, the evidence standards and their symmetry, how records propagate, and whether protected repair, review windows, and owned follow-up exist.
    conclusion: |
      The model suggests using this case to keep evaluation from substituting for correction: make criteria explicit, protect interruption and repair, require bounded Σ tests, and bind Ψ follow-up ownership.
      For safer practice under hardening, add review windows, appeal paths, and correction propagation so that revisions can change downstream consequences rather than only producing new narratives.
