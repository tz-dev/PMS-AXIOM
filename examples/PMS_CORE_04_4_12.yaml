        why_this_addon: >
          No add-on is applied. PMS core is sufficient because “meaning / sense” is treated
          structurally as frame-produced relevance (□) and stabilized integration (Σ) across
          time (Θ), under asymmetry (Ω) and non-events (Λ), rather than as a phenomenological
          report or metaphysical property.

    context: >
      A scene in which actors must determine what “this means” or whether something “makes
      sense” in order to coordinate action, allocate attention, or maintain a coherent
      trajectory. Meaning is contested when multiple frames could apply, when expected
      signals are absent, or when authority attempts to impose a preferred interpretation.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Meaning/sense is scoped as functional praxeological sense-making: what becomes
        salient, relevant, and usable for coordination inside declared frames (□), not as
        inner experience claims or ontological properties of events.
      protected_constraints:
        - "No phenomenological or psychological claims are inferred from this mapping."
        - "No metaphysical doctrine of ‘ultimate meaning’ is asserted."
        - "Meaning claims must declare the operative frame (□): purpose, admissibility, relevance rules."
        - "Reversibility applies: interpretations remain revisable under Φ and Λ."
        - "Ω must be tracked: who can impose meanings; who bears costs; who can contest."
        - "D constrains meaning-use under Ω: no shaming, coercion, or irreversible person claims."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Person-essence claims (e.g., ‘they are meaningless / senseless’) or trait attribution."
        - "Moral ranking or humiliation via ‘meaning’ vocabulary."
        - "Enforcement guidance (‘impose this meaning’) as if PMS prescribed governance."
        - "Totalizing claims that override declared frames, tolerances, and revision windows."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "Minutes to years; meaning stabilizes through repeated coordination across trajectories (Θ)."
      iteration_rhythm: "Interpretation cycles: signal → frame selection → provisional closure → revision or binding."
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "Records, narratives, and artifacts that preserve interpretations (□/Θ)."
        - "Routines and scripts that repeat interpretation patterns (Α)."
        - "Standards, policies, and identity commitments that harden meanings (Σ→Ψ)."
      reversibility_window: >
        Interpretations remain revisable while contest channels and evidence updates remain
        open (□), while Λ residues are explicit (missing signals/underdetermination), and
        while binding has not hardened a meaning into doctrine, precedent, or identity
        commitments (Ψ). Where Ψ-hardening exists, revision requires explicit Σ
        re-integration and re-authorization within the frame.
    roles:
      - role_label: "R1: Sense-maker / interpreter"
        function: "Proposes relevance and coherence relations; translates signals into meaning claims."
        exposure_profile: "Medium exposure to refutation, misfit across frames, and Φ-driven shifts."
        notes: "Carries integration load (Σ) when multiple frames compete."
      - role_label: "R2: Frame-gatekeeper / context-setter"
        function: "Defines what counts as relevant and admissible inside the frame (□)."
        exposure_profile: "High leverage; can suppress alternatives; may externalize costs under Ω."
        notes: "Controls salience rules; can accelerate Ψ-hardening."
      - role_label: "R3: Validator / reality-check role"
        function: "Tests coherence with constraints, traces, outcomes, and agreed procedures."
        exposure_profile: "Medium-to-high exposure to missed signals and ‘false sense’ lock-in."
        notes: "Often forced to operate with Λ (incomplete observables)."
      - role_label: "R4: Affected party / cost bearer"
        function: "Bears downstream consequences of adopted meanings (planning, identity, resource allocation)."
        exposure_profile: "High exposure with limited contest capacity under Ω."
        notes: "May be compelled to enact imposed meanings."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      A salient contrast emerges: competing interpretations, incompatible narratives, or a
      gap between observed signals and expected significance. Δ makes “this could mean X
      or Y” legible and forces selection.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Closure pressure to ‘make sense’ quickly: reduce ambiguity, stabilize coordination,
      protect identity coherence, or justify action. ∇ compresses open interpretation into
      a usable slogan or story.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "Expected clarification does not arrive (silence, missing context, absent explanation)."
      - "Expected evidence for an interpretation remains unavailable (hidden variables, delayed outcomes)."
      - "Expected contest/repair step does not occur (no review, no correction channel, no dialogue)."
      - "Expected frame declaration is absent (meaning asserted without stating □ relevance rules)."

  operator_mapping:
    operator_chain: ["Δ", "∇", "□", "Λ", "Α", "Ω", "Θ", "Φ", "Χ", "Σ", "Ψ"]
    reduced_signature: "Δ ∘ ∇ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α ∘ Ω ∘ Θ ∘ Φ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ ∘ Ψ"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        □ produces meaning by defining relevance: what counts as a signal, what is noise,
        which constraints apply, and what the decision purpose is. Without □, “meaning”
        becomes an unscoped status claim.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Ω shapes who can impose meanings and who must live with them. Under Ω, “sense”
        can become coercive closure if Χ and D are suspended and contest channels are blocked.
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ makes meaning trajectory-relevant: interpretations persist, accumulate, and become
        path-dependent; revisions are time-costly. Meaning is not a momentary label but a
        temporal stabilization of salience and coherence.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ is irreducible in meaning scenes: missing context, underdetermination, delayed
        feedback, and unobservable variables. PMS preserves Λ rather than laundering it into
        premature certainty.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Α stabilizes “sense-making routines”: habitual narratives, institutional scripts,
        default explanations, and recurring salience patterns that become the path of least resistance.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ shifts meaning by moving the same event into a new frame (e.g., mistake → learning,
        conflict → misunderstanding, metric → story). Transport across frames changes what
        evidence is admissible and what “makes sense.”
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ integrates heterogeneous signals, constraints, and narratives into a coherent account
        usable for coordination. Without Σ, meaning fragments into competing slogans.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ binds meanings into commitments: standards, precedents, identities, promises, doctrines,
        or stable role scripts. Ψ can stabilize coordination, but can also harden misfit meanings.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ prevents fusion of meaning with verdict. It keeps interpretations scene-bound and
        revisable, preserves Λ, and blocks meaning-as-weapon dynamics under Ω.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      A common failure is Δ/∇ → Ψ collapse: closure pressure hardens a meaning (“this is what it
      means”) without explicit □ (relevance rules/purpose), while suppressing Λ (missing context),
      ignoring Φ (frame shifts), and skipping Σ under Χ. Valid PMS application keeps meaning
      frame-bound, Λ-explicit, Φ-tracked, and reversibility live unless Ψ is legitimately warranted.

    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      Not applicable. No overlay is applied; PMS core already renders meaning/sense as
      frame-produced salience (□), Λ-bearing underdetermination, Θ lock-in, Ω exposure gradients,
      Φ transport effects, Σ integration work, and Ψ binding dynamics constrained by Χ and D.

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Gatekeepers and authorities can impose preferred meanings while downstream roles bear
      the costs of misfit: wasted effort, reputational damage, coordination failure, or enforced
      identity narratives. Contest capacity over meaning is uneven under Ω.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Once meanings are operationalized (process narratives, policy rationales, personal or
      institutional identity stories), reversal is costly. Long feedback cycles and delayed
      outcomes increase lock-in and reduce effective reversibility.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Often high: incomplete context, ambiguous signals, delayed consequences, and hidden
      variables persist. Attempts to erase Λ increase the risk of coercive or brittle meaning closure.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Declare the operative frame (□): purpose, relevance rules, admissible evidence, and tolerance for ambiguity."
      - "Keep Λ explicit: name what is missing (context, signals, feedback) instead of forcing closure."
      - "Track Φ: when an interpretation is transported across frames, restate what changes in admissibility and sufficiency."
      - "Use Σ to integrate multi-source signals and constraints rather than compressing into a single slogan."
      - "Make Ω explicit: who can impose meaning, who bears costs, and how contest channels function."
      - "Make Θ explicit: horizon, feedback cadence, persistence of records, and revision window."
      - "Apply Χ to keep interpretations scene-bound and reversible; resist meaning-as-verdict under Ω."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Meaning/sense vocabulary becomes a coercive verdict: “this is the meaning” is used to
      silence contest, shame dissent, or impose irreversible person claims under asymmetry (Ω).
    structural_indicator: >
      Ψ-hardening without Χ; Λ suppressed; Φ ignored; alternative Σ integrations blocked;
      contest channels closed; costs externalized down Ω; reversibility treated as illegitimate.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No claim about inner experience, subjective qualia, or psychological traits is made."
      - "No metaphysical thesis of ‘ultimate meaning’ is asserted."
      - "No moral ranking of persons or groups via ‘meaningfulness’ is permitted."
      - "No enforcement guidance is provided."
    claimed:
      - "Meaning/sense is modeled structurally as frame-produced relevance (□) and coherence integration (Σ) across time (Θ)."
      - "Λ residues (missing context, underdetermination, delayed feedback) are irreducible and must remain explicit."
      - "Ω shapes who can impose meanings and who bears the costs; Φ shifts meaning across frames."
      - "Ψ binds meanings into commitments and narratives; Χ + reversibility + D constrain meaning-use under Ω."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use this case to weaponize “meaning” for coercion, silencing, shaming, or
      irreversible labeling. Outputs describe how meaning-closure is produced inside frames,
      not who deserves status, authority, or exclusion.

  structural_closure: >
    PMS reframes meaning/sense as a functional closure configuration: Δ makes competing
    interpretations legible; ∇ pressures rapid sense-making; □ defines relevance and admissibility;
    Λ preserves missing context and underdetermination; Α stabilizes interpretation routines;
    Ω distributes meaning authority and cost exposure; Θ creates persistence and lock-in;
    Φ shifts meaning across frames; Χ keeps interpretations reversible and non-verdictive;
    Σ integrates heterogeneous signals into coherence; Ψ binds selected meanings into commitments,
    narratives, and standards. Where closure exceeds frame warrant, Λ remains explicit.

  plain_language_summary: >
    This case treats “meaning” and “making sense” as something that happens inside contexts:
    we decide what matters, what counts as evidence, and what story holds together well enough
    to coordinate action. Pressure to settle ambiguity can push us to lock in an interpretation
    even when key context is missing or outcomes are delayed. Meanings also change when the
    same event is moved into a different context, and power differences can turn “this is the
    meaning” into a way to control others. The point is to keep meaning claims explicit about
    their context and limits, open to revision, and non-coercive—especially when someone else
    carries the costs of getting it wrong.
