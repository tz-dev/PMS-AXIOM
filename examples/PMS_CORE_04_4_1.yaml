    context: >
      A continuity claim is demanded across time: an agent is expected to remain "the same person"
      despite memory gaps, character change, role transitions, and shifting social frames.
      The case is treated structurally (frames, commitments, trajectories), not psychologically.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        The identity question is constrained to continuity-of-reference and responsibility-relevant stability
        within declared frames (e.g., legal, relational, narrative, institutional). No metaphysical substance claim.
      protected_constraints:
        - "No person-ranking or diagnostic use"
        - "No metaphysical substance claims required"
        - "Continuity must be framed (□) and operationalized via commitments (Σ/Ψ) under temporality (Θ)"
        - "Reversibility discipline applies to identity-claims in action contexts"
        - "Dignity-in-practice (D) constrains how identity claims may be used"
      out_of_frame:
        - "Ontological identity as a metaphysical fact independent of frames"
        - "Psychological typing, trait inference, or diagnosis"
        - "Totalizing narratives that override situated frames"
    temporality:
      time_scale: "multi-year / lifetime trajectory (Θ)"
      iteration_rhythm: "repeated re-commitment and re-integration checkpoints"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "public commitments and role continuity (Σ→Ψ)"
        - "institutional records and attribution routines (□/Ω-supported)"
        - "self-binding practices that stabilize identity claims under change (Ψ)"
      reversibility_window: >
        Identity claims may be revised when frames shift (Φ) or when integration changes (Σ),
        except where hard commitments have been explicitly and legitimately bound (Ψ) under valid gates.
    roles:
      - role_label: "Agent (subject of continuity claim)"
        function: "Carrier of commitments and integration across time"
        exposure_profile: "High exposure to attribution, expectation, and responsibility assignments"
        notes: "Not treated as a psychological entity; modelled as a structural carrier of Σ/Ψ over Θ."
      - role_label: "Attributors (others / institutions)"
        function: "Apply identity labels and continuity demands within frames"
        exposure_profile: "Power varies; may impose binding labels (Ω gradients)"
        notes: "Their authority to fix labels is an asymmetry (Ω) that must be framed (□) and bounded (Χ)."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Observable differences across time: memory discontinuities, preference/character change,
      role transitions, and contextual shifts that destabilize naive sameness.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Closure demand for a single stable referent: pressure to treat the agent as identical across time
      for purposes of responsibility, trust, ownership, and narrative coherence.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "Expected continuity signals fail (e.g., forgotten commitments, broken recognition, missing memory)."
      - "Expected stability of roles does not occur (e.g., abrupt life changes, institutional rupture)."

  operator_mapping:

    # Canonical PMS chain notation matches PMS self_model formula_sequence (top-down: Ψ … Δ).
    operator_chain_order: "top_down"
    operator_chain: ["Ψ", "Σ", "Χ", "Φ", "Θ", "Ω", "Α", "Λ", "□", "∇", "Δ"]
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        Identity must be asked within a declared frame (□): legal, relational, narrative, institutional, etc.
        Frame drift (Φ) changes what counts as continuity.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Attribution power differs across contexts: institutions and others may impose labels,
        creating Ω gradients that can harden identity into authority claims.
      theta_temporality: >
        The identity problem is primarily a Θ-problem: continuity is a trajectory and a persistence relation,
        not an instantaneous property.
      lambda_residue: >
        Residue arises where closure is demanded beyond what the frame can warrant:
        gaps, discontinuities, or underdetermined continuities remain as Λ.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Recurrent patterns (Α) stabilize practical identity: habits, routines, social recognition loops,
        and institutional repetition.
      recontext_phi: >
        Identity shifts are often Φ-events: re-embedding into new frames changes what “same” means.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ integrates discontinuous episodes into a workable continuity claim (narrative, legal, relational),
        but remains frame-relative and revisable.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ binds an integrated identity claim into commitment over time (e.g., taking responsibility,
        honoring promises), producing stability without metaphysical substance.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ is required to prevent overbinding: reflective distance blocks totalizing or coercive identity claims,
        especially under strong Ω gradients.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      PMS-only case: no overlay signatures applied. Dependency hygiene follows PMS_1.1:
      □ depends on (Δ,∇); Λ depends on □; Α depends on (Δ,∇,□,Λ); Ω depends on Α;
      Θ depends on (Ω,Α); Φ depends on (Θ,Ω,□); Χ depends on (Φ,Θ,□);
      Σ depends on (Χ,Φ); Ψ depends on (Σ,Θ,Χ).
      The operator_chain is recorded in canonical top-down notation (Ψ…Δ) for audit alignment.

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Identity attribution is asymmetric: institutions (legal systems, employers) can impose durable labels;
      close relations can exert emotional or social binding pressure; the agent may have limited exit options.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Commitments (Σ) that become self-binding (Ψ) generate path dependence:
      early identity attributions can lock-in later expectations and liabilities.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Residue load includes irreducible uncertainty about continuity under frame shifts (Φ),
      non-events (Λ) such as memory gaps, and multiple admissible integrations (Σ) consistent with the same history.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Declare the relevant frame (□) before making identity claims."
      - "Treat identity as a Θ-trajectory stabilized by Σ/Ψ, not as substance."
      - "Acknowledge Λ residues (gaps, underdetermination) instead of laundering closure."
      - "Use Χ to prevent coercive or totalizing identity attributions under Ω gradients."
      - "Allow Φ-driven revision when frames change, unless legitimate Ψ commitments were made."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Identity claims can be used as coercive labels (Ω→Ψ hardening) to shame, trap, or foreclose revision,
      violating reversibility and distance discipline.
    structural_indicator: >
      Practical Σ is treated as authoritative essence: alternative frame-valid integrations are collapsed,
      Λ residues are suppressed, and attribution hardens into coercion under Ω gradients.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No metaphysical criterion of personal identity is delivered."
      - "No psychological theory of memory or character is assumed."
      - "No diagnostic or trait-based stability claim is made."
      - "No universal rule for when identity is 'real' across all frames."
    claimed:
      - "Identity is modelled as frame-relative continuity-of-reference stabilized by Σ/Ψ over Θ."
      - "Λ residues (gaps, underdetermination) are preserved rather than eliminated."
      - "Boundary conditions and a taxonomy of continuity modes can be produced at PMS-only level."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use this case to label or fix persons as essences. Identity outputs here are structural artefacts
      for framing continuity claims, not verdicts about individuals.

  structural_closure: >
    PMS delivers a bounded reframe: personal identity over time is not a substance question but a continuity
    compilation problem. Under explicit frames (□), Σ integrates histories into workable continuities and Ψ
    binds commitments over Θ. Where closure demands exceed what the frame can warrant, Λ residues remain.
    Output type: taxonomy of continuity modes and boundary statements delimiting where further closure is not
    structurally deliverable.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Instead of asking what a person "really is" across time, this case treats identity as a practical
    continuity claim made within specific contexts. Over time, commitments and integrations can stabilize a
    workable sense of sameness, but some uncertainty and discontinuity will remain. The goal is to make
    those limits explicit and prevent identity claims from being used coercively.
