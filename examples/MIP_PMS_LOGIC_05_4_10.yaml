    secondary_material: ""
    assumptions_and_inferences: |
      - This is a structural pattern reading (not a concrete real-person case).
      - MIPractice A/C/R/P are applied to enactments/roles inside inquiry and institutional settings.
      - IA box is treated as a structural check: explanation-demand becomes IA-risk when closure is enforced as authority
        (low transparency, low time-boundedness, low reversibility), not when closure is used as scoped coordination.
      - Any scoring is banded and role-dependent; no person-level attribution is intended.
    quality_and_limits:
      coverage_estimate: "medium"
      reliability_estimate: "medium"
      known_gaps:
        - "No concrete transcript, institution, or actors provided; pattern-level only."
        - "No domain-specific criteria for when closure is justified (e.g., safety-critical operations vs open inquiry)."
        - "No empirical base-rate data for frequency/severity in specific fields."
      main_bias_risks_here:
        - "frame_bias (treating closure-demand as inherently illegitimate rather than condition-dependent)"
        - "selection_bias (using a paradigmatic description without counter-examples)"
        - "hindsight_bias (reading anomalies as inevitably implying premature closure)"

  snapshot:
    short_case_description: |
      In inquiry situations, persistent non-closure (Λ) triggers a strong drive to "explain it anyway"
      and treat coherence (Σ) as settled authority. Over time, anomalies and recontextualizations (Φ)
      accumulate; if revision channels (Χ) are suppressed or priced out, correction shifts from steady
      updating to crisis-driven revision.
    central_actors_and_roles:
      - "Explainer / narrator / model-builder"
      - "Closure-demander / audience / accountability node"
      - "Evidence interface / measurement chain"
      - "Gatekeeper / certifier (optional)"
    guiding_question: |
      Under what conditions does the impulse to explain (∇) under framed inquiry (□) remain
      boundary-managed (□ ∘ Λ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ), and under what conditions does it drift toward
      coherence-as-authority that suppresses Φ/Χ and denies Λ?

    publicity_degree: "institutional"

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: |
      - Inquiry requires frames (□): admissible questions, evidence, standards of explanation.
      - Many domains require coordination under uncertainty; some closure is operationally necessary.
      - Evidence is finite and noisy; underdetermination and boundary cases can persist (Λ).
      - Institutions and incentives can stabilize explanation templates over time (Α, Θ).
    variable_elements: |
      - Whether scope is declared explicitly (what the explanation can/cannot settle).
      - Whether remainder (Λ) is carried as boundary or denied as defect.
      - Whether distance/stop-capability (Χ) is practically usable (appeal, review, dissent norms).
      - Whether recontextualization (Φ) triggers scope revision or is suppressed via patching.
      - Whether certification/gatekeeping is used as warrant substitute (Ω-inflation) or as procedural hygiene.
    unfair_high_M_zones: |
      - Roles with low access to evidence or low ability to shape frames (e.g., downstream users).
      - Situations where predictability≈0 or alternatives≈0 (time pressure, strict institutional constraints).
      - Evidence-interface roles penalized for Λ that is structurally unavoidable.
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: |
      - "We must decide now" used to avoid any review windows or correction rights.
      - "The standard requires it" used to block legitimate scope revision even when Φ shifts the domain.
      - "The model is coherent" used to treat dissent as incompetence rather than boundary signaling.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: |
        Explainers may possess strong internal knowledge of the narrative/model, while closure-demanders
        may have partial knowledge but high pressure to terminate uncertainty. Gatekeepers may know
        procedural standards but treat frame assumptions as self-evident.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: |
        Boundary cases, anomalies, measurement limits, and downstream mismatch signals are available
        when channels exist (logs, audits, peer review, stakeholder feedback).
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: |
        Confusing "coherence" with "warrant"; treating the frame (□) as reality rather than as a scope device;
        role confusion between coordinating meaning and authorizing final settlement.
    coherence:
      official_narratives: |
        "A coherent explanation is required now; the matter is settled once the story/model fits."
      visible_enactments: |
        Premature narrative completion; patching anomalies without scope revision; delegitimizing open questions;
        repetition of conclusions as substitute for reflective distance (Χ).
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: |
        High internal narrative coherence can coexist with external coherence breaks:
        the explanation claims decisive settlement while practice shows boundary policing and exception handling.
    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: |
        - When to declare scope limits (what is and is not explained).
        - When to acknowledge remainder and keep inquiry open (Λ carried).
        - When to preserve contest and correction pathways (Χ) rather than forcing settlement.
        - When institutional binding is created (Ψ + Θ) via policy, metrics, doctrine, or standards.
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: |
        In problematic variants, responsibility for mismatch is shifted onto challengers or evidence interfaces;
        responsibility is redefined as producing closure rather than stewarding revisability.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: |
        Short-term uncertainty is reduced, but long-term costs rise when anomalies accumulate and correction
        becomes crisis-driven. Downstream actors inherit lock-in and mismatch costs under Θ.
    power:
      formal_power_distribution: |
        Gatekeepers/institutions often hold authority over certification, inclusion, and standards.
      factual_power_distribution: |
        Narrative control and agenda-setting can force premature closure even without explicit rules,
        especially under time pressure and accountability rituals.
      used_alternatives: |
        - Fast closure via coherent narrative/model
        - Boundary policing (what counts as admissible question/evidence)
        - Certification as settlement marker
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: |
        - Explicit scope statements and remainder registers
        - Review windows / sunset clauses for explanations used in policy
        - Protected dissent/appeal channels with low retaliation cost
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: |
        D module remains OFF. Dignity risks are handled via structural language hygiene
        (no person devaluation; focus on roles and practices). Dignity risk appears when uncertainty
        is treated as incompetence and closure becomes humiliation/exclusion.

  ia_protection:
    transparency_measures: |
      - Require explicit scope statements: what counts as "explained" in this frame (□), and what remains open (Λ).
      - Separate coherence/fit from warrant/authority in language and reporting.
      - Record uncertainty and boundary cases as structured remainder registers.
    time_bound_measures: |
      - Introduce review windows for explanations used in institutional decisions (periodic re-evaluation).
      - Use pilot/expiry clauses for standards and metrics that embed explanations into infrastructure (Ψ + Θ).
    reversibility_measures: |
      - Maintain practical contest and correction pathways (appeals, errata, revision processes) with low retaliation cost.
      - Provide “stop-capability” checkpoints where non-closure is explicitly allowed (Χ preserved).

        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 4–9/10 (where lock-in was created)"
    course_in_words: |
      The pattern often moves from coordination under uncertainty toward settlement posture when time pressure,
      accountability rituals, or public/institutional incentives reward fast closure. Over time, Φ shifts and
      boundary cases accumulate; if review and correction channels are blocked, the system becomes brittle and
      updates occur mainly through crisis rather than steady revision.
    responsibility_viability_range: |
      Viability increases when scope, remainder handling, and correction rights are explicit and usable; it collapses when
      coherence is laundered into authority and reversibility is priced out under Ω and Ψ + Θ lock-in.

  open_questions_and_blind_spots:
    unclear_points: |
      - Which domains are in scope for the intended use (science, management, journalism, law, AI evaluation)?
      - What are the actual contest/correction channels and their costs (formal and informal)?
      - When is closure legitimately required (safety-critical, legal deadlines) vs when is it avoidable?
    missing_data_or_perspectives: |
      - Concrete examples of how anomalies were handled (patching vs scope revision).
      - Evidence-chain details (measurement limits, error rates, uncertainty reporting practices).
      - Downstream impact and correction histories (who bore costs under Θ).
    distortion_risks: |
      - Conflating necessary operational closure with authority laundering.
      - Treating narrative desire as always illegitimate rather than context-conditioned.
      - Underweighting tragedy clause: some uncertainty cannot be resolved without harm tradeoffs.

  biases_case_level:
    initial_intuition: |
      The configuration looks like "coherence used to end uncertainty," which can become an authority move.
      This intuition must be checked against explicit scope criteria, available revision pathways, and whether
      closure is time-bounded and reversible in practice.

      - "confirmation_bias"
      - "hindsight_bias"
      - "status_quo_bias"
      - "halo_effect"
    counter_reading_outline: |
      Counter-reading: some domains legitimately require temporary closure for coordination (emergency response,
      safety-critical operations, legal deadlines). In these settings, the decisive variable is not "having closure"
      but whether closure is explicitly scoped, reviewable, and reversible where possible, with uncertainty carried
      as a tracked remainder rather than denied.

  analyst_reflection:
    self_implication_notes: |
      Analysing "closure drive" risks becoming a rhetorical weapon against opponents ("you just want closure").
      This file therefore treats the phenomenon as a structural impulse under framed inquiry and foregrounds
      scope hygiene and correction rights rather than attributing motives or defects to people.
    possible_next_steps: |
      - Convert the IA protections into a minimal institutional checklist (scope statement, remainder register, review window, appeal path).
      - If a concrete case is provided, re-run with explicit materials and role-specific M-bands under the ceiling rules.

    title: "Praxeological analysis of a practice pattern: Explanation / closure drive under uncertainty"
    one_paragraph_overview: |
      This reading describes a structural pattern in which uncertainty and underdetermination trigger a strong demand
      for a clean explanation that ends contestation. Coherent narratives and models can be useful for coordination,
      but the pattern becomes risky when coherence is treated as equivalent to warranted settlement and revision
      pathways are narrowed. Over time, new contexts and boundary cases accumulate; if correction rights are blocked
      or costly, updates shift from steady improvement to crisis-driven revision. The key protection is not “less explanation,”
      but explicit scope, an explicit register of what remains open, and practical contest and correction channels.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Coherence can coordinate action, but becomes risky when treated as sufficient authority without explicit scope."
      - "The pattern becomes an IA-risk when transparency, time-boundedness, or reversibility of correction is missing in practice."
      - "Power and gatekeeping can externalize uncertainty and revision costs onto challengers and downstream users under time."
      - "Stable protections are explicit scope statements, remainder registers, review windows, and low-retaliation correction pathways."
    maturity_summary: |
      In terms of maturity in practice, the enactment pattern can show strong internal integration while remaining mixed on scope humility and revision stewardship under pressure.
    ia_box_summary: |
      Structurally, the asymmetry becomes problematic when closure is enforced as final settlement without clear criteria, review windows, or usable correction channels.
    dignity_summary: ""
    trajectory_summary: |
      Over time, the pattern often moves from coordination under uncertainty to settlement posture and then into brittleness as anomalies accumulate; where review and correction channels exist, the trajectory can reverse without crisis.
    open_questions_summary: |
      Important open questions are domain scope, the real costs of dissent and correction, and whether functioning update pathways exist in the relevant setting.
    conclusion: |
      In sum, the model suggests that the main failure is not explanation itself but converting explanation into final authority. For practice design,
      keep scope explicit, treat unresolved remainder as legitimate boundary information, and ensure correction rights remain usable as contexts change.

    attack_surface_summary: |
      **Attack Points (analysis vulnerabilities):**
      - [high (structural vulnerability / likely misread)] No concrete case material (pattern-level only)
        - Target: case.information_basis.quality_and_limits.known_gaps
        - Type: evidence_gap
        - Note: The reading is not grounded in a transcript/institution; key mechanisms (contest costs, review pathways) remain unspecified.
        - Suggested patch: Add at least one concrete vignette or transcript excerpt and map roles + correction pathways.
      - [medium (relevant uncertainty / visible leverage)] Domain-dependent thresholds not stated
        - Target: case.scores_and_ia.IA_box.justified.justification
        - Type: missing_conditions
        - Note: Justification of closure varies strongly (e.g., emergency operations vs open inquiry); criteria remain implicit.
        - Suggested patch: Add if/then criteria for when temporary closure is justified and what review requirements follow.
      - [medium (relevant uncertainty / visible leverage)] Scope breadth risks scope leakage
        - Target: case.snapshot.short_case_description
        - Type: scope_leakage
        - Note: The case spans many domains (journalism, law, AI eval, science-adjacent); readers may overgeneralize.
        - Suggested patch: Add explicit scope statement listing in-scope domains and out-of-scope variants.
      - [low (minor noise / easy patch)] Counter-reading could be tightened
        - Target: case.biases_case_level.counter_reading_outline
        - Type: counter_reading_missing
        - Note: A counter-reading is present, but could be operationalized with concrete closure-justified scenarios and safeguards.
        - Suggested patch: Add 1–2 concrete counter-examples (legitimate closure) and show how IA protections keep T/TB/R.

    hardening_actions_summary: |
      **Hardening Backlog (next iteration):**
      - [high (structural vulnerability / likely misread)] separate_observation_vs_evaluation: Add a concrete vignette/transcript and explicitly separate observed enactments from interpretive claims.
