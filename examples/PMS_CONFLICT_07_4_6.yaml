        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can represent forced choice frames (□), unavoidable remainder (Λ),
          asymmetry and exposure (Ω), time compression and lock-in (Θ), distance and
          stop-capability (Χ), integration attempts under constraint (Σ), reframing
          (Φ), and binding persistence (Ψ). But PMS core alone does not explicitly
          formalize dirty-hands situations as a closure-producing regime where
          (i) a remainder is constitutive (Λ), (ii) responsibility/binding persists
          despite unavoidable harm (Ψ under Θ/Ω), and (iii) strong drift pressure
          converts the scene into verdict theater (Σ-as-proof) or prosecution
          (“someone must be guilty”). PMS–CONFLICT adds reduced signatures + drift
          classes to keep legibility finite and to block conversion into moral
          ranking, diagnosis, or enforcement authority.

    context: >
      A decision-bearing role is placed in a framed situation where every available
      option (including inaction) violates at least one binding constraint (Ψ) and
      produces real harm. The choice is not between good and bad but between
      incompatible obligations under time pressure. The scene reliably generates
      closure pressure to output a single “right” verdict, and to convert remainder
      into blame allocation or purity testing.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Describe the structure of remainder-bearing choice under binding collision:
        why the option space is jointly non-clean, why time and exposure amplify
        closure pressure, and why “dirty hands” is a regime claim rather than a
        person verdict.
      protected_constraints:
        - "Scene-bound claims only; revisable (reversibility)."
        - "Distance (Χ) stays real: no urgency-as-proof; no verdict fusion."
        - "Dignity-in-practice (D): no shaming/ranking; no dehumanizing compression."
        - "Do not convert description into enforcement, sanction, or sorting (Φ/Ω capture risk)."
        - "Explicitly keep 'dirty hands' as remainder-structure, not as trait inference."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Trait/character inference from the choice ('this proves you are X')."
        - "Moral prosecution as the main closure device."
        - "Policy/legal guidance or institutional sanction logic."
        - "Guaranteed solution/toolkit claims ('clean method to avoid harm')."
        - "Selection/sorting (hire/fire/exclude) based on scenario answers."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "Seconds to days (decision window) with long downstream shadow (weeks to years)."
      iteration_rhythm: "Often singular acute choice; may recur as a repeated role burden (Α-template)."
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "Θ-hardening: path dependence and lock-in after the choice."
        - "Ψ persistence: durable self-binding/role-binding to the decision."
        - "Publicness/records (optional): durable artifacts that punish revision."
        - "Λ residue: missing repair/forgiveness/undoing remains load-bearing."
      reversibility_window: >
        Narrow at the moment (Θ-compression). Later Φ can re-embed meaning or
        revise premises, but cannot erase remainder if constraints persist; record
        coupling may shrink reversibility further.
    roles:
      - role_label: "R1_decision_bearer"
        function: "Carries the obligation to choose; absorbs attribution exposure and responsibility language."
        exposure_profile: "Ω(attribution/liability) high; Χ often minimized; downstream Ψ-binding likely."
        notes: "Not a character type; a structural role position in the frame."
      - role_label: "R2_affected_parties"
        function: "Bear harm exposure across options; typically low control over frame and timing."
        exposure_profile: "Ω(harm) high; Χ near-zero; voice may be filtered through frame rules."
        notes: "Do not compress into units; maintain D constraints."
      - role_label: "R3_observers_evaluators_optional"
        function: "Interpret the choice; may convert it into reputational sorting or legitimacy claims."
        exposure_profile: "Ω(narrative power) can be high; harm exposure can be low; MG risk increases with publicness."
        notes: "Key carrier of exposure-capture drift under durable records."
      - role_label: "R4_frame_designer_or_institution_optional"
        function: "Sets constraints, deadlines, and liability coupling; defines what counts as ‘available’."
        exposure_profile: "Controls □ and Θ; may offload Ω costs onto R1/R2."
        notes: "No intent attribution required; can be systemic."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      A forced binary or narrow split becomes legible: act vs refrain; harm A vs harm B;
      direct causation vs omission; rule-violation vs outcome-violation; purity vs responsibility.
    nabla_impulse: >
      High closure compulsion: “choose now,” “minimize harm,” “don’t be the cause,”
      “prove integrity.” Urgency pressures Σ into verdict mode and punishes Χ (pause)
      as evasion.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "No harm-free option exists (the clean solution is absent)."
      - "No time exists for deliberation/inquiry (Χ is priced out)."
      - "No guaranteed repair/undoing arrives afterward (Λ residue persists)."
      - "No interpretation-safe revision window exists under exposure (reversibility collapses in public contexts)."

    operator_chain: ["Ψ", "Σ", "Χ", "Φ", "Θ", "Ω", "Α", "Λ", "□", "∇", "Δ"]
    reduced_signature: "Σ ∘ Ψ ∘ Ω ∘ Θ ∘ Χ  (Λ constitutive; forced frame)"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        The situation is a high-control frame (□) that compresses option space and
        defines the closure demand. “Dirty hands” refers to the frame’s remainder-bearing
        structure, not to a moral essence.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Harm exposure concentrates on affected parties; attribution/liability concentrates
        on the decision-bearer; observers may hold narrative power with low harm exposure.
      theta_temporality: >
        Compression (“now”) plus downstream shadow (records, coordination, path dependence).
        Early moves harden trajectories; later revision becomes costly.
      lambda_residue: >
        Constitutive absence: no clean option, no full repair event, no undoing.
        Residue is not noise; it is the structure that makes “dirty hands” legible.
      attractor_alpha: >
        The dilemma form can stabilize as a repeatable template (Α): recurring crisis-choice
        framings that crowd out Φ (premise inspection) and normalize Σ-as-verdict theater.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ can reopen premises (what counts as available, who set constraints), shifting from
        guilt-talk to production-conditions. Under exposure, Φ can drift into substitution
        or prosecution (exposure capture).
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ can yield a coherent continuation (a chosen course) but cannot erase remainder if
        bindings are incompatible within the frame. Forced “perfect integration” becomes
        coercive closure.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ persists: the role may remain bound to the decision across time; colliding bindings
        can persist without moral failure. Externalizing Ψ as imposed moral authority is drift.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ is required to keep structure legible and prevent verdict fusion. The frame often
        minimizes/punishes Χ (“choose now”), creating drift pressure.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signatures are shorthand: PMS prerequisites remain authoritative (Χ depends on Φ/Θ/□;
      Σ depends on Χ/Φ; Ψ depends on Σ/Θ/Χ). Treating urgency as proof (“Σ without Χ”) or converting
      Φ/Ψ into enforcement authority indicates drift and is invalid as PMS application.

        title: "Binding collision (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Ψ + Ω + Θ + Σ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Colliding bindings (rule vs outcome; duty vs protection; legality vs safety) are staged under
          Θ-compression, and the scene demands a Σ settlement as if incompatibility were resolved.
      - signature_id: "DRIFT_asymmetry_lock_in"
        title: "Asymmetry lock-in (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Ω + Θ + Χ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Stop-capability and delay are priced; attribution exposure hardens closure. The decision-bearer’s
          hesitation becomes morally loaded while affected parties lack Χ altogether.
      - signature_id: "DRIFT_exposure_capture"
        title: "Exposure capture (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Ω + Θ + Φ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          In public/institutional circulation, attempts to reframe premises (Φ) are punished as evasion;
          interpretations harden into reputational or sanction affordances.
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "binding_collision_drift"
        label: "Binding collision (Ψ-collision)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          The core structure is a collision of bindings under a frame that does not permit a clean joint
          continuation; pressure demands a verdict-like settlement anyway.
      - drift_id: "sigma_incompatibility_clash"
        label: "Σ-incompatibility (integration clash)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Multiple coherent integration spines remain incompatible inside the forced frame; insisting on one
          “right” integration masks non-viability and escalates cost.
      - drift_id: "exposure_capture_drift"
        label: "Exposure capture (Φ under Ω/Θ with scaled publicness)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Dirty-hands talk becomes sortable content; Φ nuance becomes prosecutable material, especially with
          durable records and audience coupling.
      - drift_id: "dignity_collapse_drift"
        label: "Dignity collapse (D-constraint failure under Ω/Θ)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Counting/urgency invites shaming, purity testing, and dehumanizing compression; D fails as a language
          constraint when Σ becomes verdict theater.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      CONFLICT makes “dirty hands” readable as a closure-producing remainder regime:
      Σ can produce continuation without remainder elimination; binding collision under Θ/Ω generates forced-closure
      drift (verdict/prosecution substitution). It provides finite drift categories that prevent conversion into
      moral ranking or enforcement authority.

  drift_classification:
    drift_present: false
    drift_label: ""
    minimal_drift_signature: ""
    observable_markers:
      - "If drift occurs, it typically appears as: urgency-as-proof; Φ punished as evasion; answer used for sorting/sanction."
      - "Person-level compression: 'this proves you are X' replaces scene-bound structure."
      - "Shaming/purity testing replaces remainder-legibility (D stress)."

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Harm exposure concentrates on affected parties; attribution/liability concentrates on the decision-bearer.
      Observers may control narrative and records with low harm exposure, amplifying Ω and MG risk.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Θ-compression forces fast settlement; later correction is expensive due to path dependence, coordination
      coupling, and durable records. “Delay” itself can become costly under Ω.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      The absent clean option and absent repair/undoing event are constitutive Λ residues; they remain load-bearing
      after the decision and fuel repeated closure demands.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Declare the frame (□): identify forced-choice architecture and remainder-bearing constraints."
      - "Maintain Χ: refuse verdict fusion; keep stop-capability explicit even under time pressure."
      - "Use Φ to inspect production conditions (constraints, option space, liability coupling) without prosecution."
      - "Treat any Σ output as scene-bound settlement, not moral proof or identity verdict."
      - "Keep Ω explicit (harm vs attribution vs narrative power) rather than laundering pseudo-symmetry."
      - "Preserve D: no dehumanizing compression, no shame-based closure, no purity testing."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Dirty-hands scenes invite purity testing and shaming: “good people would never…”
      Under publicness, choices become sortable signals; affected parties may be reduced
      to units; the decision-bearer becomes a target of verdict fusion.
    structural_indicator: >
      Χ collapses into urgency; Φ becomes verdict-hardening; Σ demanded as purity proof;
      Ψ externalized as moral authority; reversibility collapses under Θ with exposure coupling;
      dignity constraints fail and dehumanizing compression appears.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "Moral truth, the 'correct answer,' or who deserves harm."
      - "Trait inference or character diagnosis from the choice."
      - "Policy/legal guidance or enforcement authorization."
      - "A method that removes remainder or guarantees clean outcomes."
    claimed:
      - "Dirty hands is a remainder-bearing forced-choice structure: Λ is constitutive, not accidental."
      - "Bindings can collide (Ψ) under Θ/Ω such that Σ cannot erase loss, only select a continuation."
      - "Public/institutional circulation creates predictable exposure-capture drift unless Χ + reversibility + D are preserved."
      - "Structural legibility does not equal authority to punish or sort."
    misuse_warning: >
      High misuse risk when dirty-hands language is used for purity tests, reputational prosecution, selection/sorting,
      or governance authority. Under high publicness/durable records, require explicit mode/publicness/misuse declarations
      or refuse transfer.

  structural_closure: >
    This case specifies dirty hands as a forced-choice remainder regime: the frame (□) compresses option space and time (Θ),
    asymmetry (Ω) separates harm from attribution and narrative power, and structured absence (Λ) makes a clean solution
    unavailable. Integration (Σ) can yield a coherent continuation but cannot remove remainder under binding collision (Ψ),
    while distance (Χ) must be preserved to prevent verdict fusion and exposure capture (Φ under Ω/Θ). PMS–CONFLICT closes
    the case by producing finite legibility and drift boundaries without converting the scene into moral ranking or enforcement.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Dirty-hands situations are forced choices where every option causes real harm or violates an important commitment.
    Structurally, the “missing clean option” is the point: you can choose a path, but you can’t erase the remainder.
    Because time and exposure add pressure, these scenes often get turned into purity tests or blame machines.
    This case keeps the structure readable while blocking shaming, person-judgments, and enforcement drift.
