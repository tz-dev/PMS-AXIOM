        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can represent repair as Φ/Χ-enabled revision, Σ integration of mismatched
          expectations, and Ψ self-binding to carried commitments across Θ under real Ω.
          But PMS core alone does not explicitly formalize the EDEN-typical drift corridor where
          "repair talk" becomes a standing/loyalty instrument: □ drifts into tribunal/value-relation,
          Λ residues are either denied (P-Λ-DN) or retained as leverage, Σ is simulated (P-Σ-SIM),
          and Ψ is externalized ("you must forgive/trust/accept") rather than re-established as
          Ψ→Self. The EDEN overlay supplies drift handles, reduced signatures, and cost markers
          to keep repair legible as re-opening coordination carriers (Σ/Ψ) rather than as moral
          settlement or coercive closure.

  scene_packet:
    scene_id: "Recurring relationship repair attempt after accumulated non-closures"
    context: >
      A relationship (pair/team/institutional dyad) has accumulated residues (Λ) across Θ
      under real exposure gradients (Ω). One or more repair attempts occur (apology, clarification,
      renegotiation, boundary-setting, restitution). The repair either re-opens Σ/Ψ as carriers
      (interface change + owned commitments) or drifts into substitutes (tribunal framing, performance,
      denial, forced forgiveness).
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Repair as praxis-relation: converting Λ residues into coordinatable interface adjustments (Σ)
        and re-established owned binding (Ψ→Self), under reversible distance (Χ) and dignity constraint (D).
      protected_constraints:
        - "Scene-bound and role-bound repair (no global person labels)."
        - "Reversibility window remains real: questions/verification allowed (Χ not punished)."
        - "D constraint: no shaming, ranking, humiliation, loyalty tests, or forced forgiveness."
        - "Ω speakable as functional gradients (capacity/exposure/obligation/leverage), not verdict surfaces."
        - "Repair does not require total closure; partial repair is allowed (Λ can be reduced without erasure)."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Motive/character adjudication; diagnoses; trait claims."
        - "Irreversible verdicts ('always/never'); public tribunals as 'repair.'"
        - "Enforcement guides; sanction design; coercive prescriptions."
        - "Automatic obligation derivations that bind the other (Ψ→Other) as a repair criterion."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "mid to long (weeks to years; often multi-episode)"
      iteration_rhythm: "episodic repair attempts with daily/weekly background interactions"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "Λ residues persist as open remainder across Θ (unacknowledged events, missing follow-through)."
        - "Α scripts stabilize (avoidance, demand loops, performance repair, monitoring)."
        - "Narrative embedding via Φ without interface change can harden trajectories."
      reversibility_window: >
        Often initially moderate-to-high (Χ available), shrinking if Χ becomes priced as betrayal
        and Σ is repeatedly simulated or blocked, producing Θ lock-in.
    roles:
      - role_label: "R1 — Higher-exposure / residue carrier"
        function: "Bears downstream cost of non-closure; often initiates repair to restore viability."
        exposure_profile: "Ω↑ exposure/cleanup risk; Θ↑ accumulation sensitivity"
        notes: "Risk: chronic Λ becomes leverage/tribunal surface; withdrawal becomes rational under Ω/Θ."
      - role_label: "R2 — Lower-exposure / repair gatekeeper (may invoke closure)"
        function: "Can acknowledge, disclose, and bind repair commitments; can also deny or perform repair."
        exposure_profile: "Ω asymmetrically priced; lower immediate cost for deferral/denial"
        notes: "Risk: Φ-only repair; Ψ externalization ('you must move on'); Χ punished."
      - role_label: "R3 — Audience / institution (optional)"
        function: "Amplifies standing frames; rewards harmony display; penalizes repair questions."
        exposure_profile: "Low direct cost; high amplification capacity"
        notes: "Risk: repair becomes performance/tribunal; Σ replaced by optics."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Mismatch between (a) declared relational continuity ("we are fine / repaired") and
      (b) the consequence geometry: persistent residues (Λ), ongoing Ω gradients, and Θ accumulation.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Pressure to restore viability (reduce friction, re-enable cooperation) versus pressure to protect
      standing/avoid cost (deny, deflect, force closure, convert repair into loyalty test).
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "Acknowledgment/disclosure does not occur where expected (Λ persists)."
      - "Concrete interface change does not occur (Σ absent) while repair is verbally claimed."
      - "Revision/verification is not permitted (Χ priced/punished)."
      - "Commitment ownership is not self-adopted (Ψ→Self absent); obligations imposed (Ψ→Other)."

    reduced_signature: >
      REPAIR_RELATIONSHIPS = □(praxis-relation) ∘ Λ ∘ Ω ∘ Θ ∘ Φ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ ∘ Ψ
      (viable repair: Χ real + Σ enacted + Ψ→Self; drift: □→tribunal + Σ simulated + Ψ→Other)
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        Repair is valid only if □ stays praxis-relation (coordination/interface) rather than value-relation
        (standing/loyalty tribunal). □ drift converts repair into verdict allocation and blocks Σ.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Repair is Ω-sensitive: who bears exposure, who can refuse, who pays repair labor, and who carries
        downstream risk. If Ω is unspeakable, repair shifts into substitutes (performance/loyalty demands).
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ makes residues cumulative: repeated non-repair episodes reduce reversibility and increase repair cost.
        Repair viability depends on timing (early Σ/Ψ re-opening has outsized impact).
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ is not nothing: missing acknowledgment, missing disclosure, and missing follow-through persist as
        open remainder and can become leverage/tribunal surface if not converted via Σ.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Scripts stabilize: denial loops, apology-performance, monitoring, forced closure, or avoidance/exit.
        Once Α forms, repair attempts may default to scripted substitutes.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ is necessary for re-framing without verdicts (context update), but Φ-only repair is a drift marker
        if it replaces interface change (Σ) and binding (Ψ→Self).
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ is the repair carrier: concrete interface synthesis (roles, boundaries, checkpoints, restitution forms).
        Without Σ, repair becomes narrative/standing talk and residues persist.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ stabilizes repair only as self-binding (Ψ→Self): owned commitments carried across Θ. Drift signature:
        externalization (Ψ→Other: "you must forgive/trust/stop asking") or misbinding to appearance-management.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ keeps repair reversible and non-tribunal: pause, clarify, verify, and name Ω without humiliation.
        Drift marker: Χ punished as disrespect/betrayal; repair becomes coercive closure.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signatures are shorthand. Canonical dependencies apply (Χ presupposes Φ/Θ/□; Σ presupposes Χ/Φ;
      Ψ presupposes Σ/Θ/Χ).

    active_signatures:
      - signature_id: "META"
        title: "Meta-signature: self-control > other-control"
        formula: "META = (Ψ ∘ Χ) applied to Ω-handling (D constraint) > Ψ→Other demands with substitutes"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Repair is viable when commitment and restraint are self-carried (Ψ→Self with Χ real) rather than
          imposed as loyalty/forgiveness demands (Ψ→Other).
      - signature_id: "RECIPROCITY_LOSS"
        title: "Reciprocity loss trajectory (erosion under Θ)"
        formula: "RECIPROCITY_LOSS = Θ-erosion of Σ/Ψ-carried coordination under real Ω with chronic Λ and stabilized Α"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Failed repair cycles (Λ retained, Σ absent/simulated, Ψ displaced) predict erosion under Θ even if
          surface harmony is maintained via Φ/Α substitutes.
      - signature_id: "G3_frame_recontextualization"
        title: "G3 — Frame recontextualization (value-relation → praxis-relation)"
        formula: "G3 = Φ shifts □ back to praxis-relation; Ω speakable; Λ converted into Σ-work across Θ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Structural repair requires a Φ move that restores □ as coordination frame and re-opens conversion
          of residues (Λ) into interface change (Σ).
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "P-Σ-SIM"
        label: "Σ-Simulation instead of Integration"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Repair can be performed in language/ritual while interfaces do not change, leaving Λ intact and
          binding misbound to appearance rather than carried commitments.
      - drift_id: "P-Ψ-EXT"
        label: "Ψ → Externalization (“You must…”)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Repair talk often drifts into obligation demands on the other (forgive, forget, trust, comply),
          substituting compliance tests for Σ/Ψ→Self.
      - drift_id: "P-Λ-DN"
        label: "Λ → Denial / Suppression (“Nothing happened”)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          To avoid repair cost or standing loss, residues are minimized; Φ pseudo-closure supports Α avoidance,
          but Λ persists structurally and returns across Θ.
      - drift_id: "chapter_11_reciprocity_loss"
        label: "Reciprocity loss (erosion trajectory)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          When repair cannot re-open Ω speakability and Σ/Ψ carriage, repeated episodes accumulate under Θ and
          stabilize scripts (Α), producing predictable channel erosion.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      EDEN highlights that "repair" can be structurally counterfeit: tribunal framing, performance repair, forced
      closure, and forgiveness-as-obligation function as substitutes that keep Λ open and shift costs under Ω,
      accelerating Θ erosion. It supplies drift handles to separate viable repair (Σ/Ψ→Self with Χ real) from
      standing-regulation disguised as repair.

  drift_classification:
    drift_present: true
    drift_label: "Repair-as-performance / forced-closure repair (□ tribunal drift)"
    minimal_drift_signature: >
      Δ + □(praxis→value-relation) + Λ chronic + Ω salient + Θ accumulation with Χ priced,
      Σ low/simulated, and Ψ externalized/misbound; Α stabilizes scripts.
    observable_markers:
      - "Questions/verification (Χ) are punished as betrayal; repair requires silence/compliance."
      - "Apology/repair rituals occur without interface change (Σ absent) and residues persist (Λ retained)."
      - "Repair becomes standing allocation (who is 'good/bad') rather than coordination conversion."
      - "Obligations are imposed on the other (Ψ→Other: forgive/trust/stop asking) instead of owned commitments."
      - "Repeated cycles stabilize (Α) and cooperation erodes under Θ."

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Repair labor and risk are uneven: higher-exposure roles pay for uncertainty and downstream cleanup;
      lower-exposure roles can defer/deny at low immediate cost; audiences can amplify standing frames without
      carrying consequences.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Each failed repair episode compounds: reversibility shrinks, trust/coordination bandwidth decreases,
      and later repair has weaker effect once scripts (Α) and narratives (Φ) harden under Θ.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Residues (Λ) accumulate as open accounts: missing acknowledgment, missing disclosure, missing follow-through.
      If not converted via Σ, Λ becomes leverage/tribunal surface and increases drift pressure.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Using Φ narrative repair to reduce immediate conflict when Σ change is costly."
      - "Avoiding disclosure to prevent standing loss inside tribunal-□."
      - "Increasing private monitoring or withdrawing effort under Ω/Θ exposure."
      - "Seeking closure rituals to stabilize appearances when coordination channels are weak."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: "Repair is substituted by humiliation, shaming, loyalty tests, or forced forgiveness."
    structural_indicator: >
      Χ becomes socially priced; repair conversations shift to tribunal framing; Σ is replaced by verdicts;
      Ψ shifts to coercive demands (Ψ→Other) or binds to appearance-management.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "That any person is 'the problem' or motives are transparent."
      - "That repair requires total closure or perfect symmetry."
      - "That forgiveness/trust are owed or enforceable."
    claimed:
      - "Repair is structurally viable only when Χ is real, Σ is enacted, and Ψ is self-bound (Ψ→Self) under Ω/Θ."
      - "Tribunal/value-relation framing converts repair into substitutes that retain Λ and accelerate Θ erosion."
      - "Chronic residues and stabilized scripts predict reciprocity loss unless coordination carriers reopen."
    misuse_warning: >
      High misuse risk if converted into a coercion template ("you must repair like this") or person-labeling.
      Keep mappings scene-bound, revisable, and dignity-constrained; do not weaponize Ψ/Σ language as authority.

  structural_closure: >
    In PMS–EDEN, relationship repair is not a moral settlement but a carrier restoration problem:
    convert Λ residues into coordinatable interface change (Σ) under a praxis-relation □, preserve
    reversibility via Χ, and re-establish durable ownership as Ψ→Self across Θ under real Ω.
    Drift occurs when repair becomes tribunal/standing logic: Χ is priced, Σ is simulated, Ψ is
    externalized, and Α stabilizes substitutes—producing predictable erosion under Θ.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Repair isn’t “who is right” or “who is good.” Structurally, repair works when people can pause and
    clarify without punishment, make a concrete change that prevents the same problem, and actually carry
    commitments over time. Repair drifts when it becomes a loyalty test or a performance: questions are
    punished, nothing really changes, and one side is told to “just forgive.” Then the leftovers keep piling
    up and cooperation erodes.
