        why_this_addon: >
          PMS-core models trust-relevant structures (□, Λ, Α, Ω, Θ) but does not, by itself,
          enforce the anticipation-specific boundary discipline that keeps Λ open under Θ while
          preventing probability-talk from becoming authorization. The ANTICIPATION overlay adds
          reduced signatures and drift markers for miscalibration (Λ→certainty, Χ-erosion,
          Ω-instrumentalization, Ψ-externalization), enabling calibration reports and boundary policies
          without turning trust into prophecy or coercion.

    context: >
      A trust relationship must be calibrated under uncertainty: an agent must decide how much reliance,
      access, delegation, or vulnerability is structurally admissible in a bounded role-space. The calibration
      problem is not "who is good/bad" but how to tune reliance under persistent underaccess (Λ), asymmetric
      exposure (Ω), and time-dependent lock-in (Θ), while preserving revisability (Φ) and restraint (Χ).
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Trust is treated as a scene-bound coordination parameter: a configurable reliance stance within an
        explicit frame (□) that specifies stake level, failure modes, and what counts as update-worthy signals.
        Trust is not an ontological verdict about minds, not a moral ranking, and not a guarantee claim.
      protected_constraints:
        - "Trust calibration remains frame-relative (□): role, stake, and permissible reliance are explicit."
        - "Λ is carried: uncertainty about intentions/inner states and future behavior is not eliminated."
        - "Reversibility: calibration must remain revisable under Φ where feasible; no global labels."
        - "Χ remains active: no fusion into certainty, urgency, or enforcement claims."
        - "D constrains opacity-handling under Ω: no humiliation, coercion, or dehumanizing treatment."
        - "Σ integrates signals into a stance, but does not totalize into truth or authority."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Global person evaluation (trustworthy/untrustworthy 'as such')."
        - "Intent attribution as settled fact (mind-reading claims)."
        - "Prescriptive interpersonal advice or therapeutic instruction."
        - "Institutional enforcement guidance or sanction design."
        - "Metaphysical closure about sincerity, consciousness, or 'true character'."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "multi-episode interaction trajectory (Θ): weeks to years depending on stake horizon"
      iteration_rhythm: "repeated interaction cycles with update checkpoints after salient events or non-events"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "pattern stabilization through repeated outcomes/non-outcomes (Α with Λ)"
        - "role-based expectation loops and repair cycles within the frame (□)"
        - "records, reputational traces, and institutional memory (Θ-amplifiers)"
        - "self-binding to update norms (Ψ): 'we revise calibration under new evidence'"
      reversibility_window: >
        Calibration is revisable while (i) exit options exist, (ii) commitments are not irrevocably bound,
        and (iii) Φ remains available (new context/new data can change the frame or interpretation).
        Reversibility shrinks when Θ-lock-in grows (e.g., long-term delegation, irreversible commitments,
        institutionalization of Σ into durable status).
    roles:
      - role_label: "R₁: Trusting agent / calibrator"
        function: "Sets reliance level and interprets signals within □; bears some error costs under Θ"
        exposure_profile: "Exposure depends on stake and delegation depth; vulnerability increases with Ω"
        notes: "Modelled structurally as a stance-holder bound by Χ/Ψ, not as a psychology."
      - role_label: "R₂: Trusted party / target of reliance"
        function: "Receives access, reliance, or delegation; may be burdened by suspicion or proof-demands"
        exposure_profile: "Can be harmed by miscalibration via exclusion or coercive testing under Ω"
        notes: "Not evaluated as 'good/bad'; treated as a role in a calibration scene."
      - role_label: "R₃: Third parties / institutions (optional)"
        function: "Amplify or harden trust calibration into durable status (Σ→institutional fixation)"
        exposure_profile: "High leverage; can impose Ω gradients and reduce reversibility"
        notes: "Critical when trust outputs become transferable (credentials, reputation, gatekeeping)."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Differentiation between signals that invite reliance vs signals that demand caution:
      consistency vs volatility, repair behavior vs repeated non-repair, aligned vs misaligned
      interpretations of the frame (□), and stake-dependent differences in tolerated error.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Pressure to settle calibration quickly: desire for security, coordination, speed, belonging,
      or control. Under stress, ∇ pushes toward closure (certainty) or toward defensive totalization
      (global distrust), especially under high Ω and closing Θ-windows.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "No decisive proof event arrives that guarantees future reliability or sincerity."
      - "Expected repair/clarification does not occur (silence, delay, ambiguity persists)."
      - "Expected consistency signals are absent or underdetermined (mixed evidence remains)."

    operator_chain_order: "top_down"
    operator_chain: ["Ψ", "Σ", "Χ", "Φ", "Θ", "Ω", "Α", "Λ", "□", "∇", "Δ"]
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        Calibration must declare the frame (□): what reliance means here, what counts as breach,
        which stakes are in play, and which signals are admissible as evidence.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Trust is structurally about exposure gradients: one party may bear larger downside risk,
        while the other may bear dignity harm through suspicion, surveillance, or exclusion.
        Third parties can amplify Ω by converting stance into status.
      theta_temporality: >
        Trust is a Θ-trajectory: reliance changes over repeated episodes, and commitments can lock-in.
        Closing windows (Θ) intensify pressure to decide, increasing drift risk.
      lambda_residue: >
        Underaccess and underdetermination persist: trust cannot be closed into certainty without substitution.
        Λ must remain carried as an explicit boundary, not treated as a defect to erase.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Repeated outcomes and non-outcomes (Λ) stabilize patterns (Α): reliability loops, repair loops,
        and also suspicion loops. Α can support viable calibration or harden maladaptive attractors.
      recontext_phi: >
        New context can reframe the meaning of prior signals (Φ): the same behavior changes meaning
        under different stakes, roles, or constraints. Calibration requires Φ-availability.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ integrates mixed signals into a workable stance (e.g., bounded reliance with explicit limits),
        but does not justify totalizing claims about the other. Σ remains policy-level coherence, not truth.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ binds the calibrator to update/repair discipline: commitments about how calibration will be revised,
        how consequences are owned, and how restraint is maintained under confirmation or stress.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ is the stop-capability that prevents (i) premature certainty, (ii) paranoia totalization,
        and (iii) coercive proof-demands. Χ keeps calibration reversible and scene-bound.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signatures are shorthand only. PMS prerequisites remain authoritative (PMS_1.1):
      □ depends on (Δ,∇); Λ depends on □; Α depends on (Δ,∇,□,Λ); Ω depends on Α;
      Θ depends on (Ω,Α); Φ depends on (Θ,Ω,□); Χ depends on (Φ,Θ,□);
      Σ depends on (Χ,Φ); Ψ depends on (Σ,Θ,Χ).
      Any configuration that presents Σ as final without Χ (or treats Ψ as an obligation imposed on others)
      indicates drift risk and is invalid as a PMS application.

    active_signatures:
      - signature_id: "ANT_min"
        title: "Minimal anticipatory stance (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Δ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Θ ∘ Χ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Trust calibration begins as an anticipatory stance: bounded reliance is defined in □,
          Λ is kept explicit (no guarantee), Θ is respected (trajectory/lock-in), and Χ prevents
          closure laundering or coercive testing.
      - signature_id: "ANT_viable_full"
        title: "Viable anticipatory configuration (full PMS chain)"
        formula: "Δ ∘ ∇ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α ∘ Ω ∘ Θ ∘ Φ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ ∘ Ψ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Viable calibration disciplines closure drive (∇), uses pattern stabilization (Α) without
          converting it into certainty, audits exposure (Ω), respects time-irreversibility (Θ),
          stays revisable (Φ), maintains restraint (Χ), integrates signals into stance (Σ),
          and self-binds the calibrator to update/repair norms (Ψ).
      - signature_id: "ANT_to_planning_constraint"
        title: "Constraint for any downstream planning / preparedness"
        formula: "requires: Χ + D + reversibility"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          When trust calibration produces downstream consequences (delegation depth, access, reputational
          effects, institutional gating), explicit gates apply: Χ and reversibility must be maintained,
          and D must constrain how asymmetry is handled.
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "certainty_replaces_Λ"
        label: "Λ replaced by certainty"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Calibration pressure under stress converts probabilistic patterns (Α/Σ) into claims of guaranteed
          reliability or guaranteed threat; Λ is denied and revision rights shrink.
      - drift_id: "Χ_suspended"
        label: "Χ suspended ('I know better')"
        why_plausible_here: >
          High stakes or prior confirmation erodes distance: the calibrator treats their integration as
          decisive verdict, enabling escalation or hard exclusion.
      - drift_id: "Ω_instrumentalized"
        label: "Ω instrumentalized"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Underaccess is used as leverage: proof-demands, surveillance, humiliation, or coercive constraints
          are justified as 'necessary' for trust.
      - drift_id: "Ψ_externalized"
        label: "Ψ externalized ('others must act now')"
        why_plausible_here: >
          The calibrator shifts binding outward by demanding the other 'prove' sincerity/reliability
          beyond what □ can warrant, converting stance into imposed obligation.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      The overlay distinguishes a present, disciplined trust stance (carrying Λ under Θ) from prophecy-like
      closure and from coercive enforcement. It supplies explicit invalidity markers for miscalibration:
      Λ-collapse (certainty), Χ-erosion (loss of stop-capability), Ω-instrumentalization (power via opacity),
      and Ψ-externalization (binding shifted to the other). This enables calibration reports and boundary policies
      without importing moral verdicts or metaphysical claims.

  drift_classification:
    drift_present: false
    drift_label: ""
    minimal_drift_signature: ""
    observable_markers:
      - "Not classified without a concrete scene; only drift risks are enumerated."

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Exposure is uneven: reliance decisions can place one party at higher risk of loss, harm, or dependency,
      while miscalibration can subject the other to stigma, exclusion, or coercive monitoring. Institutions can
      magnify Ω by turning calibration into durable status (credentialing, blacklisting, gatekeeping).
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Over time, calibration decisions can become costly to reverse: deeper delegation, shared infrastructure,
      and public commitments create lock-in. Θ-pressure rises when windows close (urgent decisions), increasing
      the temptation to collapse Λ into certainty.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Residue load is the irreducible uncertainty about motives, future behavior, and hidden constraints.
      Attempts to erase Λ typically substitute brittle proxies (tests, purity demands, surveillance), increasing
      drift risk and dignity harm under Ω.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Declare the calibration frame (□): stakes, reliance scope, and what counts as update-worthy signals."
      - "Carry Λ explicitly: treat uncertainty as a boundary condition, not as a defect requiring certainty."
      - "Use Α as gradual stabilization: rely on repeated patterns and repair loops rather than single-shot verdicts."
      - "Maintain Χ under stress and after confirmation: prevent both paranoia totalization and triumphalist certainty."
      - "Keep Φ available: allow recontextualization when constraints or roles shift; do not freeze interpretation."
      - "Treat Σ as stance integration with explicit limits; do not totalize into global person claims."
      - "Bind the calibrator via Ψ to revision/repair discipline; do not externalize Ψ as proof-demands on others."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Miscalibration can weaponize opacity: uncertainty becomes warrant for humiliation, surveillance, coercive
      testing, exclusion, or dehumanizing narratives—especially when third parties institutionalize Σ into status.
    structural_indicator: >
      Λ is denied (certainty substituted), Χ collapses (no stop-capability), and Ω is instrumentalized
      (power leveraged via underaccess). Ψ is externalized as obligation on the other ("prove it") rather than
      binding the calibrator to restraint and accountable updating.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No psychological theory of trust, attachment, or personality is assumed."
      - "No intent or sincerity detection is claimed."
      - "No prescriptive interpersonal advice is provided."
      - "No global classification of persons as trustworthy/untrustworthy is licensed."
      - "No governance or enforcement guidance is delivered."
    claimed:
      - "Trust calibration is modelled as a frame-bound stance under persistent non-closure (Λ) over time (Θ)."
      - "Viable calibration maintains distance (Χ), revisability (Φ), and dignity constraints (D) under asymmetry (Ω)."
      - "ANTICIPATION overlay drift markers specify how calibration commonly fails (Λ→certainty, Χ-erosion, Ω misuse, Ψ externalization)."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not convert calibration into verdict or status. Do not treat uncertainty as warrant for coercion,
      humiliation, or irreversible labeling. Do not externalize binding as proof-demands on others; binding in this
      lens is primarily the calibrator’s commitment to restraint, revision discipline, and consequence ownership.

  structural_closure: >
    Calibrating trust correctly is specified as a stance-formation problem: within an explicit frame (□),
    agents must integrate mixed signals (Σ) across repeated interaction patterns (Α) over time (Θ) while carrying
    irreducible underaccess (Λ). PMS–ANTICIPATION closes the case by providing a calibration architecture:
    maintain Χ to block closure laundering, keep Φ-driven revision available, audit Ω exposure gradients, and
    bind the calibrator via Ψ to update/repair discipline rather than converting uncertainty into authority.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Trust can’t be made certain because we don’t have direct access to other people’s inner states or future
    choices. So trust has to be calibrated: you decide how much reliance makes sense in a specific situation,
    and you stay able to revise that decision when things change. The key is to keep uncertainty explicit,
    avoid turning patterns into guarantees, and avoid using suspicion or “proof demands” as a way to control or
    degrade others. This model treats good calibration as stable-but-revisable trust under real time and risk.
