    short_case_description: >
      A responsibility claim must be allocated in a frame-bound setting where duties, repair,
      and accountability are distributed under unequal exposure and capacity across time.
      The key risk is premature closure: turning a scene-bound allocation into an irreversible
      label or coercive cost-dumping.

    publicity_degree: "institutional"

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: >
      - Declared responsibility frame (legal / institutional / professional / operational / caregiving).
      - Protected goods: dignity in practice (no humiliation), contestability, repair viability.
      - Time horizon and irreversibility constraints (records, audits, precedent, handover points).
      - Power gradients (who can assign/enforce vs who bears cost).
    variable_elements: >
      - How evidence is gathered and communicated; how handovers are documented.
      - Whether integration is done (multi-factor mapping) or replaced by single-cause closure.
      - Whether contest channels and revision windows are practically usable.
      - Whether responsibility is distributed, layered, or concentrated.
    unfair_high_M_zones: >
      - Where predictability is low (missing handovers/evidence, delayed signals) or alternatives are absent.
      - Where the exposed role lacks authority/resources to act but is still expected to "own" outcomes.
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: >
      - Where allocator roles invoke “the system” to avoid taking responsibility for design choices,
        resource alignment, or contest channel availability.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: >
        In mature configurations, roles explicitly know (or declare they do not know):
        the operative frame, evidence limits, handover points, and time horizon.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: >
        Warning signals include missing handover documentation, delayed feedback, and
        mismatches between duty and capacity (duty-without-power).
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: >
        Typical blind spots: conflating cause with liability; confusing responsibility with blame;
        ignoring how publicity/records harden attribution over time.

    coherence:
      official_narratives: >
        Common narratives: “someone must be accountable,” “we need an owner,” “this is not my job,”
        “policy requires…”.
      visible_enactments: >
        Enactments range from explicit allocation with revision rights to diffuse deflection,
        scapegoating, or coercive “accountability” rituals.
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: >
        Coherence breaks when responsibility is demanded without providing authority/resources,
        or when “contestability” is promised but practically punished.

    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: >
        - Initial assignment (incident/triage).
        - Handover decision points (delegation, documentation).
        - Repair ownership (who must do what by when).
        - Review/revision points (when new information arrives).
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: >
        - Taking: ownership with explicit scope and revision conditions.
        - Shifting: cost-dumping down exposure gradients.
        - Refusing: diffusion drift (“no one owns it”), or procedural deferral.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: >
        Consequences accumulate across time: delayed repair, repeated harm, reputational residues,
        institutional lock-in, and eroded trust.

    power:
      formal_power_distribution: >
        Allocator/authority roles typically hold formal decision rights; exposed roles often hold
        operational burden; affected parties depend on channels for recognition and repair.
      factual_power_distribution: >
        Factual power tracks access to information, documentation control, sanction power,
        and the ability to define the frame and its thresholds.
      used_alternatives: >
        Mature alternatives: distributed responsibility mapping; explicit handover protocols;
        reversible assignments; protected contest channels; resource alignment.
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: >
        Blocked alternatives include: inability to challenge assignments; absence of revision windows;
        pressure to accept blame for speed/closure; punishment for raising uncertainty.
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: >
        Dignity risk concentrates where responsibility talk becomes humiliation, coercion,
        or irreversible labeling under power asymmetry.

    title: "Praxeological analysis of practice: responsibility assignment and binding"
    one_paragraph_overview: >
      This analysis treats responsibility as a practical allocation and binding process: deciding who must
      repair, own, or carry a duty when power and exposure are unequal and consequences unfold over time.
      The central risk is premature closure: turning a scene-bound allocation into humiliation, coercion,
      or an irreversible label. A viable responsibility practice keeps the operative frame explicit, makes
      evidence limits and handover gaps visible, aligns duty with actual capacity to act, and preserves
      review and revision rights so that responsibility can be corrected as new information arrives.

      - "Responsibility is most viable when duty, authority, resources, and revision rights are aligned; otherwise it becomes cost shifting."
      - "Missing handovers, incomplete evidence, and delayed signals are normal; treating them as proof drives scapegoating or diffusion."
      - "Power gradients shape who can assign and who bears consequences; contest channels must be practically usable."
      - "Record and policy effects can harden attributions over time; explicit review points protect against irreversible labeling."
      - "Misuse risk rises when responsibility language becomes humiliation or when it is used to justify sanctions without a clear scope and evidence basis."

    maturity_summary: >
      In terms of maturity in practice, the configuration is more mature when the responsibility frame is explicit,
      uncertainty is admitted, repair ownership is concrete, and revision rights remain live—especially under power asymmetry.

    ia_box_summary: >
      Structurally, problematic asymmetry appears when assignments are not transparent, not justified by controllable levers,
      not bounded in time, or not reversible in practice; the risk is highest where contestability is penalized.

    dignity_summary: ""

    trajectory_summary: >
      Over time, responsibility allocations tend to either stabilize into repair-oriented ownership with review points,
      or harden into doctrine/labels as records accumulate—making later correction costly even when new information arrives.

    open_questions_summary: >
      For any concrete application, the decisive open questions are: which duty frame applies, what documentation exists
      for handovers and controllability, and whether contest and revision channels are genuinely usable under pressure.

    conclusion: >
      In sum, responsibility should be treated as a bounded, revisable allocation for repair and coordination—not as a
      person verdict. The most reliable protections are explicit scope, documented handovers, aligned authority/resources,
      and time-bounded review windows that keep correction possible and reduce dignity risks.

    attack_surface_summary: |
      **Attack Points (analysis vulnerabilities):**
      - [high (structural vulnerability / likely misread)] Thresholds for justified responsibility assignment remain underspecified
        - Target: case.scores_and_ia.IA_box.justified
        - Type: missing_conditions
        - Note: The abstract case names risks, but does not specify concrete if/then thresholds for when assignment is justified vs cost-dumping.
        - Suggested patch: Add 3–5 conditional criteria (controllability, documentation quality, resource alignment, contestability) as explicit thresholds.
      - [medium (relevant uncertainty / visible leverage)] Responsibility vs blame remains a term ambiguity corridor
        - Target: case.frame_vs_variability.frame_elements
        - Type: term_ambiguity
        - Note: Readers may still conflate responsibility allocation with moral blame, despite guardrails.
        - Suggested patch: Add one short disambiguation block: responsibility (allocation for repair) vs blame (person valuation) with exclusions.
      - [medium (relevant uncertainty / visible leverage)] Publicity / record effects are treated implicitly
        - Target: case.role_mapping.publicity_degree
        - Type: publicity_context_collapse_risk
        - Note: Institutional visibility is assumed but not stress-tested across publicity levels; misuse risk changes with public amplification.
        - Suggested patch: Add a small matrix: private vs institutional vs public—how reversibility and dignity risk shift.
      - [low (minor noise / easy patch)] Counter-reading could be sharper
        - Target: case.biases_case_level.counter_reading_outline
        - Type: counter_reading_missing
        - Note: A stronger counter-reading would test the cost of keeping responsibility too revisable (repair paralysis).
        - Suggested patch: Add one concrete scenario: why fast assignment can be necessary and how to keep it bounded without labeling.

    hardening_actions_summary: |
      **Hardening Backlog (next iteration):**
      - [high (structural vulnerability / likely misread)] add_if_then_criteria: Define explicit justification thresholds for responsibility assignment (controllability, evidence quality, resource alignment, contestability, repair viability).
        - Linked to attack point: 0
        - Expected effect: PH+1; IA.J more decidable; misuse corridor narrower
      - [medium (relevant uncertainty / visible leverage)] define_terms: Add a short term split: responsibility-allocation vs blame/valuation, with explicit exclusions.
        - Linked to attack point: 1
        - Expected effect: PH stable; dignity-language risk down
      - [medium (relevant uncertainty / visible leverage)] add_publicity_guardrails: Add a publicity-level mini-grid (private/institutional/public) describing reversibility shrink and dignity risk.
        - Linked to attack point: 2
        - Expected effect: PH stable; IA.R and dignity risk more decidable under transmission
      - [low (minor noise / easy patch)] add_counter_reading: Add one concrete counter-scenario about repair paralysis under over-reversibility.
        - Linked to attack point: 3
        - Expected effect: PH stable; scope robustness up
