    secondary_material: ""
    assumptions_and_inferences: |
      - Pattern-level structural reading only (no concrete empirical vignette, transcript, institution, or identifiable persons).
      - "Tragedy" is treated as a structural remainder regime: non-eliminable loss persists even under competent, dignity-constrained praxis.
      - IA box is used as a legitimacy screen for any *attempt* to turn tragedy-legibility into coercive closure (blame, sanction, selection, governance authority).
      - M-responsibility is treated as role- and leverage-dependent: higher for roles shaping constraints, publicity, records, and closure enforcement;
        lower for roles facing near-zero alternatives under Θ/Ω.
    quality_and_limits:
      coverage_estimate: "medium"
      reliability_estimate: "medium"
      known_gaps:
        - "No empirical vignette/transcript; template-level structural scene only."
        - "Publicity/record coupling is described as optional; no concrete publicness level given for an actual instance."
        - "No concrete institutional embedding: who enforces closure, who controls records, and what downstream coupling exists remains unspecified."
        - "No concrete protected-good justification for any imposed decision pressure; only generic constraints are stated."
      main_bias_risks_here:
        - "abstraction_bias (overfitting a rich structure to too-generic situations)"
        - "frame_bias (treating the tragedy frame as exhaustive and missing avoidable harms)"
        - "moralization_bias (drift into guilt/virtue narratives despite stated prohibitions)"
        - "authority_laundering_risk (using 'structural tragedy' talk to evade accountability for avoidable choices)"

  snapshot:
    short_case_description: |
      A situation contains incompatible obligations/constraints such that any continuation produces real loss.
      The structure invites closure demands (someone must be at fault; there must be a clean solution), even though
      the remainder is non-eliminable. The analysis aims to keep tragedy legible as structure under Θ and Ω while
      preserving Χ (distance) so the case does not collapse into Σ-as-verdict, blame, or governance authority.

      - "R4_Constraint_setter_environment_optional"
    guiding_question: |
      How can a tragedy-structured remainder be made legible (as Λ under □ with Θ/Ω/Ψ) while preventing drift into
      coercive closure (blame/sanction/selection), especially under publicity and durable records?

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: |
      - Non-eliminable remainder (Λ): within the frame there is no clean option and no guaranteed relief event.
      - Binding collision (Ψ): multiple locally valid commitments cannot be jointly satisfied.
      - Θ hardening: trajectories accumulate; revision becomes costly; later reinterpretations cannot undo losses.
      - Ω gradients: harm exposure and attribution exposure are unevenly distributed; observers may hold narrative power.
      - Χ is required for legibility: distance/pausing prevents fusion into verdict, authority, or moral purity claims.
      - D constraints: no shaming, ranking, humiliation; no dehumanizing compression of affected parties.
    variable_elements: |
      - Publicness/record coupling: private processing vs institutional audit vs media amplification.
      - Availability and pricing of Χ: whether pausing/refusal is socially/institutionally permitted or punished.
      - Use of Φ (reframing): premise inspection/production-conditions vs substitution/cover-story that pretends remainder is gone.
      - How Σ is handled: coherent continuation with remainder acknowledged vs Σ-as-verdict used as moral proof.
      - Institutional embedding: who controls constraints, timelines, and downstream coupling (selection/sanction/policy).
    unfair_high_M_zones: |
      - R1: if alternatives≈0 under Θ/Ω, high individual M/blame would be unfair; responsibility shifts to constraint/publicity lever holders.
      - R2: harmed parties should not be treated as responsible for the remainder; dignity risk if reduced to moral units.
      - Any actor pressured into instant closure where Φ/Χ are blocked: M ceilings apply (model ceiling_rule).
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: |
      - "It's tragedy/structure" used to evade responsibility for avoidable harms, missing mitigation, or preventable Ω exploitation.
      - "No one could have done otherwise" asserted without checking which levers (publicity, records, constraint design, resource allocation) were actually controllable.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: |
        Actors can often see that all available continuations carry loss, but may under-perceive how Ω (exposure gradients) and Θ (hardening)
        amplify closure demands, and may not distinguish structural remainder from avoidable co-causes.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: |
        Escalating solution-demand; insistence on a single clean narrative; blame hunting; urgency escalation; punishment of pauses (Χ);
        public/institutional recording that hardens narratives; reframing (Φ) treated as evasion or as manipulation.
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: |
        Confusing structural legibility with moral exoneration; confusing naming remainder with denying responsibility for mitigations;
        confusing observers’ narratives with truth; missing R4/R3 leverage in responsibility allocation.
    coherence:
      official_narratives: |
        "There must be a right answer." "Someone must be at fault." "If you were mature, you could solve this." "Stop reframing and decide."
      visible_enactments: |
        Attempts to force Σ-as-verdict; blame cycles; purity tests; narrative hardening into records; delegitimizing Χ; Φ used as prosecution
        (recontextualization into accusation) or as substitution (cover story of resolution).
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: |
        Coherence can be locally high within one binding spine, but joint coherence remains structurally limited by Ψ-collision and Λ remainder.
        Coherence breaks when language claims resolution or purity while outcomes still carry remainder, or when "tragedy" talk is used to excuse avoidable harm.
    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: |
        - Declare the frame (□): name remainder and limits (no moral verdict, no authorization).
        - Preserve Χ: protect pausing/refusal; prevent coercive closure by urgency or audience.
        - Use Φ for production-conditions: distinguish structural remainder from avoidable system choices.
        - Allocate responsibility by leverage: name R3 (publicity/records) and R4 (constraints) as high-impact sites where available.
        - Protect D constraints: prevent shaming, ranking, and dehumanizing compression; prohibit downstream selection/sanction coupling.
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: |
        Responsibility often shifts onto R1 as personal guilt, while R3 narrative power and R4 constraint-setting remain under-scrutinized.
        Conversely, responsibility can also be refused via "structure did it" rhetoric that blocks practical mitigations and repair attempts.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: |
        Under publicity, Θ-hardening increases: revisions and nuance become socially costly; affected parties can be reduced to symbols.
        Blame-driven closure can produce secondary harms (shaming, scapegoating, exclusion) on top of the remainder itself.
    power:
      formal_power_distribution: |
        Template-level: varies by embedding. In institutional contexts, authorities can enforce timelines, records, and sanctions; in private contexts,
        power is more dispersed. Media amplification multiplies exposure without proportional control.
      factual_power_distribution: |
        R4 holds structural influence over constraints/option space; R3 holds narrative and publicity leverage; R1 carries concentrated attribution exposure;
        R2 carries harm exposure with low control and reduced access to Χ.
      used_alternatives: |
        - Producing a continuation (Σ) while attempting to keep bindings explicit (Ψ)
        - Narrative stabilization (Α) via shared story, rituals, or institutional documentation
        - Recontextualization (Φ) to reframe meanings (sometimes toward production conditions, sometimes toward prosecution)
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: |
        - Pausing/refusal (Χ) protected without penalty
        - Premise inspection and option-space expansion (Φ as inquiry, not substitution)
        - Participation of affected parties in deciding what counts as acceptable remainder-handling
        - Sunset/review and record-limitation to prevent Θ-hardening via durable public artifacts
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: |
        D module remains OFF. Dignity risk is handled structurally: the main risk is secondary harm via shaming/ranking and dehumanizing compression
        when tragedy is converted into blame or public prosecution.

  ia_protection:
    transparency_measures: |
      - Declare the frame (□): tragedy = remainder-bearing structure; output is descriptive, not a verdict or authorization.
      - Make constraints explicit in any concrete application: what bindings collide, what options are excluded, who controls timelines and records.
      - Name Ω gradients: distinguish harm exposure, attribution exposure, and narrative power.
    time_bound_measures: |
      - Time-bound any institutional processing: defined review checkpoints; prevent indefinite reuse of narratives/records as standing prosecution tools.
      - If public communication occurs, use sunset norms for circulation: discourage durable re-amplification of blame narratives.
    reversibility_measures: |
      - Preserve contestability: protect Χ (pause/refusal) and Φ (premise inspection) without penalty.
      - Prohibit irreversible downstream coupling: no hiring/firing/sanction/selection logic derived from tragedy-legibility outputs.
      - Keep scene-bound language: no essence claims; explicit correction clauses for reinterpretation.

        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 5–8/10 (highest for actors enabling prosecution, durable records, or selection coupling)"
    course_in_words: |
      The scene tends to move from initial legibility efforts toward closure-demand escalation as Θ and Ω amplify costs and exposure. Where Χ is protected
      and Φ remains inquiry-oriented, the trajectory can stabilize as "legibility without resolution." Where publicness/records harden outputs, tragedy talk
      drifts into blame/prosecution and generates secondary harms.
    responsibility_viability_range: |
      Viability is highest when □ is declared, Χ is protected, Φ remains premise inspection, and any documentation is time-bounded and revisable.
      Viability collapses when Σ is demanded as moral proof, when publicness/records harden narratives, and when outputs are operationalized for sanction/selection.

  open_questions_and_blind_spots:
    unclear_points: |
      - What is the concrete embedding (private / institutional / media), and what is the actual publicity/record coupling?
      - Who holds R4-like constraint power and R3-like narrative power in the real instance?
      - Are Χ (pause/refusal) and Φ (premise inspection) practically available or socially punished?
      - Which mitigations are possible (distinguishing structural remainder from avoidable co-causes)?
    missing_data_or_perspectives: |
      - Concrete vignette showing how closure demands are enacted and by whom.
      - Evidence about downstream coupling (sanction/selection/policy) and whether outputs are reused over time.
      - Affected-party perspectives on dignity impacts and what "legibility" practices feel protective vs prosecutorial.
    distortion_risks: |
      - Treating tragedy category as a blanket exoneration (structure-as-excuse).
      - Overgeneralizing from template to all hard conflicts (abstraction_bias).
      - Underestimating how record/publicness coupling can transform legibility language into weapons (publicity_context_collapse_risk).

  biases_case_level:
    initial_intuition: |
      "Tragedy" here functions as a protective frame: it blocks coercive closure and prevents moral sorting by insisting on remainder and on the need for Χ.
    named_bias_risks:
      - "confirmation_bias"
      - "hindsight_bias"
      - "status_quo_bias"
      - "halo_effect"
      - "moralization_bias"
    counter_reading_outline: |
      Counter-reading: some cases labeled "tragic" are not structurally remainder-bearing but are avoidable products of poor constraint design,
      misallocated resources, or power abuse (Ω exploitation). In those cases, tragedy language risks laundering responsibility and delaying repair.
      A safe application must test for avoidable co-causes and specify which constraints are truly hard vs socially produced.

  analyst_reflection:
    self_implication_notes: |
      Calling a situation "tragic" can be used both to protect dignity (against scapegoating) and to evade accountability (for avoidable harms).
      This reading therefore keeps tragedy strictly structural and scene-bound, and it explicitly requires checking for avoidable levers before accepting
      "non-eliminable remainder" as the right frame.

      - Add one concrete vignette and map: bindings (Ψ), constraints (□), alternatives (Χ), reframing channels (Φ), time hardening (Θ), and exposure gradients (Ω).

    title: "Praxeological analysis of a practice pattern: Tragedy as structural remainder category"
    one_paragraph_overview: |
      This reading treats “tragedy” as a structural situation where there is no clean option: every continuation causes real loss, and time makes revision harder.
      The key risk is not the loss itself, but how people respond to it—by forcing a verdict, hunting a culprit, or turning the situation into a purity test.
      The analysis therefore focuses on keeping the situation readable as structure while protecting the ability to pause, reframe premises, and avoid shaming or
      dehumanizing language. It stays scene-bound and does not authorize sanctions, selection, or governance enforcement based on the label “tragic.”
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Tragedy here is remainder-bearing: binding commitments collide, so full resolution is structurally non-viable even under mature practice."
      - "Time and exposure intensify closure demands; durable records and publicness can turn legibility talk into prosecution."
      - "A maturity move is to protect distance (pause/refusal) and keep reframing as premise inspection, not as cover-story or accusation."
      - "Responsibility should follow leverage: those who control constraints and publicity/records carry higher co-responsibility than constrained decision-bearers."
    maturity_summary: |
      In terms of maturity in practice, the pattern supports adult enactment when it resists false closure and keeps remainder legible without blaming or authorizing enforcement.
    ia_box_summary: |
      Structurally, IA risk rises when closure demands become non-transparent, unjustified, indefinite, or non-contestable—especially when pauses are punished and narratives are hardened into durable records.
    dignity_summary: ""
    trajectory_summary: |
      Over time, the constellation tends to drift from legibility toward blame/prosecution as time hardens and exposure increases, unless pause and premise inspection remain protected.
    open_questions_summary: |
      Important open questions are the concrete embedding (publicness/records), who controls constraints and narratives, and which parts of the loss are truly non-eliminable versus avoidable.
    conclusion: |
      The model suggests using “tragedy” as a structural category to prevent scapegoating and purity-test closure, not as an exoneration device.
      For safer practice, declare limits, protect pause and premise inspection, and prevent downstream coupling into sanctions or selection—especially under publicness.
