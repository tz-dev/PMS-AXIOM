    assumptions_and_inferences: |
      - Pattern-level structural reading only (no empirical vignette, identifiable persons, or institution specified).
      - “Dirty hands” is treated as a remainder-bearing frame: no clean option exists; Σ can select a continuation but cannot erase Λ.
      - IA box is used as a legitimacy screen for drift into verdict theater, purity testing, or enforcement-by-language under exposure.
      - M-responsibility is treated as leverage-dependent: higher for roles controlling □/Θ/records/publicness coupling; lower where Χ≈0 and time is compressed.
    quality_and_limits:
      coverage_estimate: "medium"
      reliability_estimate: "medium"
      known_gaps:
        - "No concrete vignette/data; scenario remains template-level."
        - "Publicness/record coupling is optional/variable; no concrete embedding specified."
        - "No concrete constraint topology: who set □ and Θ, what alternatives existed, and what repair channels exist is unspecified."
        - "No protected-good justification for any downstream coercion/enforcement; analysis remains non-authorizing."
      main_bias_risks_here:
        - "abstraction_bias (overfitting the template to too-many real cases)"
        - "hindsight_bias (judging choices with outcomes known)"

  snapshot:
    short_case_description: |
      A decision-bearing role must choose under time pressure in a frame where every available option (including inaction)
      violates at least one binding commitment and produces real harm. The structure reliably triggers closure demands for a
      single “right” verdict, and drift toward blame allocation, purity testing, or prosecution—especially under publicness
      and durable records.

    guiding_question: |
      How can a remainder-bearing forced-choice structure be made legible as □+Θ+Ω+Ψ+Λ (with Χ preserved and Φ used for premise/production inquiry)
      while preventing drift into verdict theater, purity tests, reputational prosecution, or enforcement-by-language?

  role_mapping:
    object_of_observation:
      type: "practice_pattern"
      label: "Dirty hands / forced choice as remainder-bearing decision frame"
      description: "A forced-choice frame where incompatible bindings (Ψ) under Θ-compression make Λ constitutive; Ω separates harm exposure, attribution/liability, and narrative power; Χ is pressured; Φ can reopen premises but risks exposure-capture drift."
    other_relevant_roles:

      power_position_reflection: "The analyst’s language can become a verdict tool: either scapegoating the decision-bearer or laundering ‘no-fault’ inevitability; keep outputs system-bound, reversible, and explicitly non-authorizing."
    publicity_degree: "variable"

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: |
      - Forced-choice architecture: option space is jointly non-clean under incompatible bindings (Ψ).
      - Θ-compression: decision window is narrow; downstream shadow is long.
      - Λ is constitutive: absence of a clean option and absence of full repair/undoing remain load-bearing.
      - Ω gradients separate (i) harm exposure (R2), (ii) attribution/liability exposure (R1), (iii) narrative/record power (R3/R4).
      - Χ is required for legibility but is often priced/punished by the frame (“choose now”).
    variable_elements: |
      - Publicness and record coupling (private vs institutional vs media-amplified) and durability of artifacts.
      - Who controls □ and Θ: designed crisis vs emergent constraint; degree of discretion.
      - Availability/pricing of Χ: pause/appeal/consultation/exit protections vs retaliation.
      - Φ handling: premise/production inquiry vs prosecution substitution (“evasion” accusations).
      - Σ handling: iterative containment vs one-shot verdict theater; repair channels and time-bounded review.
      - Participation of affected parties in defining acceptable tradeoffs and repair thresholds.
    unfair_high_M_zones: |
      - R1: where Θ is acute and alternatives are structurally narrow, high personal M/guilt totalization is unfair.
      - R2: where Χ≈0 and harm is unavoidable across options, blaming affected parties is structurally misleading.
      - Any actor forced into instant closure where consultation and appeal are blocked: M ceiling_rule applies.
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: |
      - “No one had any choice” asserted without mapping who set □/Θ and what mitigations were available.
      - “Dirty hands” used as an exoneration device to block avoidable lever checks (repair design, transparency, complaint protections, record/publicity coupling).

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: |
        Actors often perceive the urgency and harm tradeoffs, but may not perceive the frame mechanics:
        how □ definitions, Θ deadlines, and record/publicity coupling constrain alternatives and amplify attribution.
        Observers may conflate outcome dislike with moral essence claims about the decision-bearer.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: |
        “Choose now” demands; refusal of pause/consultation; purity language (“good people would never…”);
        use of answers for sorting/sanction; durable records that prevent revision; attacks on nuance (“evasion”);
        absence of repair/forgiveness pathways; scapegoating dynamics.
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: |
        Confusing structure (remainder-bearing frame) with exoneration or with prosecution authorization;
        treating the decision as trait evidence; ignoring R4’s leverage in designing constraints and repair;
        collapsing Φ inquiry into “justification”; mistaking Σ settlement for moral proof.
    coherence:
      official_narratives: |
        “There was a right answer.” “Integrity means purity.” “If you hesitate, you are guilty.”
        “If harm happened, someone must be bad.” “Rules required it, so no one is responsible.”
      visible_enactments: |
        Forced compression of deliberation; selection of a continuation under constraint; after-the-fact verdict debates;
        public/institutional circulation that hardens interpretations into durable records; attempts to reframe premises (Φ)
        either enabled (audit/production inquiry) or punished (prosecution substitution).
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: |
        Local coherence can be high (actors follow procedures) while joint coherence fails (no option satisfies all bindings).
        Coherence breaks when purity narratives deny constitutive remainder, or when “structure” rhetoric blocks avoidable mitigations.
    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: |
        - Declare the unit (□): describe forced-choice architecture and remainder, not person essence.
        - Preserve Χ: protect pause/consultation/appeal where possible; block urgency-as-proof.
        - Use Φ for premise/production inquiry: who set constraints, what alternatives were removed, what repair is possible.
        - Allocate responsibility by leverage: identify constraint designers/record/publicity controllers (R4/R3) vs constrained roles (R1/R2).
        - Prevent downstream coupling: do not use scenario answers as sanction/selection logic.
        - Keep D constraints: prohibit shaming, purity tests, and dehumanizing compression.
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: |
        Responsibility often shifts onto the visible chooser (R1) via scapegoating, while constraint design and record/publicity power remain under-scrutinized.
        Conversely, responsibility can be refused via “inevitability” claims that ignore mitigations and repair levers.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: |
        Under Θ, harms occur immediately; under records/publicness, narratives harden and become difficult to correct.
        Verdict-driven closure can add secondary harms (shaming, exclusion, reputational destruction) beyond the original remainder harm.
    power:
      formal_power_distribution: |
        Template-level: varies by embedding. Institutions often centralize deadline setting, liability coupling, and documentation rules;
        affected parties typically have low control over timing and option space.
      factual_power_distribution: |
        R4/R3 may control □ definitions, Θ deadlines, records, and publicity; R1 bears attribution exposure; R2 bears harm exposure with near-zero Χ.
        Publicness amplifies consequences without proportional control for affected parties.
      used_alternatives: |
        - Immediate settlement (Σ) under constraint: choosing a continuation.
        - Procedural justification narratives (sometimes) to restore coherence.
        - Recontextualization (Φ) toward premises/audits (sometimes) or toward prosecution (drift risk).
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: |
        - Protected pause/consultation/appeal (Χ) without retaliation.
        - Time-bounded review checkpoints and correction clauses after the acute choice.
        - Record-limitation/sunset norms to preserve reversibility under durable artifacts.
        - Participation of affected parties in defining acceptable tradeoffs and repair thresholds.
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: |
        D module remains OFF. Dignity risk is handled structurally: the primary risk is secondary harm via shaming, purity testing,
        scapegoating, and dehumanizing compression when remainder-legibility is converted into person-level verdicts.

  ia_protection:
    transparency_measures: |
      - Declare the unit (□): forced-choice architecture and remainder, not person worth or trait inference.
      - Separate observation vs evaluation: document constraints, option space, timing, and exposure/record coupling before any moralized interpretation.
      - Name Ω gradients: distinguish harm exposure, attribution/liability exposure, and narrative/record power.
      - Explicitly mark what is inference vs what is case material in any concrete instance.
    time_bound_measures: |
      - Introduce post-decision review checkpoints (time-bounded reassessment) where feasible.
      - Define escalation limits: prevent indefinite purity/verdict debates from becoming durable governance artifacts.
      - If the dilemma recurs (Α-template), time-bound redesign cycles for constraints and repair pathways.
    reversibility_measures: |
      - Protect contestability: allow revision of interpretations without treating it as evasion (Χ protection).
      - Prevent irreversible downstream coupling: no sanction/selection logic derived from “dirty hands” framing alone.
      - Record-limitation/sunset norms where publicness and durable artifacts would harden narratives.

        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 4–8/10 (highest for actors enabling enforcement-by-language and durable record coupling)"
    course_in_words: |
      The pattern moves from acute settlement under Θ-compression toward narrative hardening and legitimacy contestation.
      Where Χ is protected and Φ remains premise/inquiry-oriented, the trajectory stabilizes as “remainder acknowledged without verdict fusion.”
      Where exposure/records harden outputs, the scene drifts into purity testing, scapegoating, and prosecution substitution.
    responsibility_viability_range: |
      Viability is highest when □ is explicit, Χ is protected, Φ remains premise inquiry, and post-choice review is time-bounded and reversible.
      Viability collapses when Σ is demanded as moral proof, when publicness/records harden narratives, and when outputs are operationalized for sanction/selection.

      - Perspectives of affected parties on what would count as protective repair vs prosecutorial closure.
    distortion_risks: |
      - Overgeneralizing from the template to cases with avoidable alternatives (abstraction_bias).
      - Hindsight moralization: treating outcomes as proof of inner essence (moralization_bias).
      - Structure-as-excuse: using remainder talk to evade avoidable mitigation responsibilities.

  biases_case_level:
    initial_intuition: |
      “Dirty hands” functions as a remainder frame: it keeps the absence of a clean option legible and blocks purity/verdict closure,
      but it is also easily weaponized (as condemnation) or misread as exoneration.

    counter_reading_outline: |
      Counter-reading: some scenes described as “forced choice” are not fully remainder-bearing—alternatives exist but were excluded by convenience,
      institutional incentives, or poor frame design. A safe application must map concrete □/Θ control and plausible mitigations before accepting
      “no clean option” as structurally true.

  analyst_reflection:
    self_implication_notes: |
      Dilemma language is powerful: it can protect dignity against scapegoating, but it can also shield avoidable harms or justify coercion.
      This reading therefore stays system-bound, preserves reversibility and Χ, and requires an avoidable-lever check before treating the frame as truly remainder-bearing.
    possible_next_steps: |
      - Add one concrete vignette and map: □ constraints, Θ deadlines, option space, Ω distributions, Χ availability/pricing, Φ handling, record coupling.
      - Specify publicness level and add matching safeguards (record limits, sunsets, correction clauses, anti-sanction coupling).
      - Add explicit if/then criteria for when verdict/purity closure becomes IA-relevant coercion (punished Χ, weaponized Φ, selection coupling).
      - Add a short checklist distinguishing hard constraints from avoidable design choices and mitigations.

    title: "Praxeological analysis of a practice pattern: Dirty hands / forced choice as remainder-bearing decision frame"
    one_paragraph_overview: |
      This reading treats “dirty hands” as a structural forced-choice frame: under time pressure, every available option (including inaction)
      violates at least one binding commitment and causes real harm. The key issue is not finding a morally pure answer but keeping the remainder
      legible and preventing the situation from collapsing into a blame machine or purity test. The analysis therefore separates harm exposure,
      attribution exposure, and narrative power, preserves pause/appeal where possible, and uses premise inquiry to examine who set constraints and
      what repair exists. It stays system-bound and does not authorize sanctions, selection, or reputational enforcement based on dilemma talk.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Dirty hands is modeled as a remainder-bearing frame: Λ is constitutive; Σ can select a continuation but cannot erase loss under Ψ collision."
      - "Θ-compression and Ω gradients separate harm exposure (R2), attribution/liability exposure (R1), and narrative/record power (R3/R4)."
      - "Χ (pause/appeal/consultation) is central for maturity but is often priced/punished; attacking Χ drives prosecution drift."
      - "Φ can reopen premises (constraints, option space, liability coupling), but under publicness/records tends to drift into exposure-capture unless constrained."
      - "Misuse risk: dilemma language becomes purity testing, scapegoating, or sanction/selection coupling—creating secondary harms beyond the remainder harm."
    maturity_summary: |
      In terms of maturity in practice, the pattern supports adult enactment when it keeps the unit structural, protects pause/appeal, and sustains premise inquiry without collapsing into verdict theater.
    ia_box_summary: |
      Structurally, IA risk rises when closure demands become non-transparent, unjustified, indefinite, or non-contestable—especially when pauses are punished and narratives are hardened into durable records.
    dignity_summary: ""
    trajectory_summary: |
      Over time, the constellation tends to drift from acute settlement under Θ-compression toward narrative hardening and purity/verdict closure unless pause/appeal and premise inquiry remain protected.
    open_questions_summary: |
      Important open questions are the concrete embedding (publicness/records), who set constraints and deadlines, how pause/appeal is priced, and what repair pathways exist.
    conclusion: |
      The model suggests using “dirty hands” to keep remainder and constraint design legible and to block scapegoating and purity testing.
      For safer practice, declare the unit, protect pause/appeal, time-bound review, and prevent downstream coupling into sanctions or selection—especially under publicness and durable records.
