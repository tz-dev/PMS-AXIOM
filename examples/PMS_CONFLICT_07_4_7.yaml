        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can represent asymmetry (Ω), temporality and lock-in (Θ), distance/stop-capability (Χ),
          and their interactions with framing (□), non-events (Λ), and recontextualization (Φ). But PMS core
          alone does not explicitly formalize the CONFLICT-specific drift corridor where unequal access to
          pause/exit/appeal becomes a power gradient that stabilizes incompatibility: (i) χ-availability
          becomes selective, (ii) delay and procedure become leverage channels (Λ as load-bearing), and
          (iii) interpretive moves (Φ) under exposure are converted into pressure rather than revisable
          structure. The CONFLICT overlay supplies reduced signatures + drift classes to keep this regime
          finite and legible without turning it into blame, diagnosis, or enforcement authority.

    context: >
      A multi-role interaction (relationship, organization, institution, platform, or procedural system)
      exhibits persistent asymmetry in who can pause, exit, delay, appeal, or reframe without penalty.
      χ (distance/stop-capability) is formally "available" but is priced differently across roles, making
      interruption rights asymmetric. This stabilizes a conflict or dependency regime: the more exposed role
      cannot safely stop, while the less exposed role can defer or withdraw cheaply.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Describe a regime in which distance/exit/appeal (Χ) is structurally priced asymmetrically under Ω/Θ,
        stabilizing incompatibility and leverage channels—without person-level blame, moral ranking, or
        enforcement authorization.
      protected_constraints:
        - "Scene-bound regime claims only; no global person labels (reversibility)."
        - "Maintain Χ as analytic distance; do not fuse into verdict or urgency-as-proof."
        - "D (dignity-in-practice) constrains language: no shaming/ranking/humiliation; no dehumanizing compression."
        - "Do not convert the description into sanction logic, reputational enforcement, or selection/sorting."
        - "Keep Ω explicit as structural distribution of exposure/control/capacity; avoid pseudo-symmetry narratives."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Trait inference ('this proves they are X')."
        - "Intent attribution as primary explanation ('they meant to trap you')."
        - "Policy/legal guidance or enforcement mandates."
        - "Guaranteed resolution/toolkit claims ('do Y and it will be fixed')."
        - "Public prosecution, reputational sorting, or institutional punishment recommendations."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "Mid-to-long (weeks to years), with punctuated acute moments (deadlines, crises, escalation)."
      iteration_rhythm: >
        Repeated cycles of: pressure → attempted pause/appeal → penalty differential → renewed dependence.
        Often includes deadline cycles, response-window asymmetry, or procedural loops.
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "Θ-hardening: path dependence increases cost of interruption over time."
        - "Ω-gradient: unequal exposure/liability/control over timing and records."
        - "Λ residue: missing acknowledgments/corrections become load-bearing."
        - "Α stabilization: the 'who can pause' pattern becomes the default script."
        - "Optional: durable records / institutional coupling amplify irreversibility."
      reversibility_window: >
        Often narrowing: early interruption may be possible at moderate cost, but repeated cycles and record
        coupling harden the regime so later attempts to exit/pause become disproportionately costly for the
        high-exposure role.
    roles:
      - role_label: "R1_high_exposure_position"
        function: "Carries higher harm/penalty exposure; depends on continuity; limited safe stop-capability."
        exposure_profile: "Ω(harm/penalty)↑, Χ priced, Θ lock-in↑"
        notes: "May include dependents, precarious roles, liability-bearing positions, or socially exposed actors."
      - role_label: "R2_low_exposure_position"
        function: "Has lower penalty exposure; can delay/withdraw/reframe at lower price; controls timing levers."
        exposure_profile: "Ω(control/timing)↑, Χ cheap/available, Θ lock-in externalized"
        notes: "Not a moral claim; a structural position that can exist within institutions or relationships."
      - role_label: "R3_procedural_or_platform_layer_optional"
        function: "Defines windows, deadlines, eligibility, escalation paths; couples action to records."
        exposure_profile: "Ω(record power)↑, Θ coupling↑, Φ as enforcement affordance risk"
        notes: "May be an institution, policy regime, platform architecture, or bureaucratic process."
      - role_label: "R4_observers_audience_optional"
        function: "Amplify exposure; convert partial interpretations into durable consequences."
        exposure_profile: "MG↑ under publicness; Ω narrative power may exceed harm exposure"
        notes: "Raises risk of exposure capture and dignity collapse under audience coupling."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      A split becomes legible between 'formal availability of stopping/appealing' and 'practical ability to
      do so without penalty'. χ is uneven: one side can pause/exit, the other cannot.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Closure pressure pushes continuation without symmetric interruption: 'respond now', 'don’t escalate',
      'be reasonable', 'stick to process'. Under asymmetry, urgency becomes proof and delay becomes leverage.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "Expected symmetric pause/appeal does not materialize (Χ not equally usable)."
      - "Expected protection/correction after an appeal is absent or delayed."
      - "Expected acknowledgment/repair does not occur; silence becomes load-bearing residue."
      - "Expected 'time will fix it' event fails; Θ increases cost instead."

  operator_mapping:
    operator_chain: ["Ψ", "Σ", "Χ", "Φ", "Θ", "Ω", "Α", "Λ", "□", "∇", "Δ"]
    reduced_signature: "Ω ∘ Θ ∘ Χ  (+ Λ residue; Α stabilization; Φ exposure risk)"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        The frame defines what counts as 'legitimate stopping' vs 'defection', which procedures exist, and
        what penalties attach to delay/exit. Framing often masks asymmetry by treating formal availability
        as practical symmetry.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Core: unequal distribution of exposure, liability, dependency, timing control, and record power.
        χ-availability becomes an Ω channel: the ability to pause/withdraw is itself a power gradient.
      theta_temporality: >
        Time converts asymmetry into lock-in: repeated cycles harden trajectories; waiting increases cost
        for the high-exposure role; deadlines and response windows function as Θ-compression devices.
      lambda_residue: >
        Missing correction/protection/acknowledgment events accumulate as residues that become leverage
        channels: non-response, delay, or procedural deferral carry structural consequences.
      attractor_alpha: >
        The interaction stabilizes into a repeatable script: 'R1 must continue; R2 can pause'. The script
        reproduces itself even if local intentions vary.
      recontext_phi: >
        Reframing can expose production conditions (who sets windows, who bears penalties), but under
        exposure it can drift into prosecution or narrative substitution, hardening claims into pressure.
      distance_chi: >
        χ is the central contested resource: formally present, practically priced. Asymmetric χ undermines
        symmetric interruption and makes 'take a step back' a privilege rather than a stabilizer.
      integration_sigma: >
        Integration attempts can be coherent locally (process fixes, agreements) yet fail if χ remains
        priced asymmetrically; Σ becomes theater when it presupposes symmetric stop-capability that
        the regime does not provide.
      binding_psi: >
        Binding persists for R1 (responsibility, dependence, identity, role obligation), increasing
        vulnerability to lock-in. Attempts to externalize Ψ as moral compulsion ('you must stay calm/engaged')
        are drift risks.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signatures are shorthand. PMS prerequisites remain authoritative: Χ depends on Φ/Θ/□,
      Σ depends on Χ/Φ, and Ψ depends on Σ/Θ/Χ. Treating formal 'exit exists' as equivalent to real χ,
      or demanding Σ while χ is priced asymmetrically, indicates drift and is invalid as PMS application.

        formula: "Ω + Θ + Χ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Exit/appeal/stop-capability is present but priced unevenly; time and exposure convert χ-availability
          into a power gradient that stabilizes incompatibility and dependence.
      - signature_id: "DRIFT_exposure_capture"
        title: "Exposure capture (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Ω + Θ + Φ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          In public/institutional settings, attempts to reframe the asymmetry are punished; revision becomes
          costly and interpretive moves harden into enforcement affordances.
      - signature_id: "CONFLICT_stabilized_pattern"
        title: "Stabilized conflict attractor (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Α + Ω + Θ + Ψ + Χ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          The asymmetry of χ stabilizes as a recurring pattern: repeated cycles reproduce who can pause
          and who cannot, turning the relation into a durable regime.

        label: "Asymmetry lock-in (Χ priced asymmetrically)"

          Central structure: differential penalty for pause/exit creates lock-in and timing control.

        label: "Exposure capture (Φ under Ω/Θ with scaled publicness)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          If observers/records couple to claims, reframing becomes prosecutable; reversibility collapses.
      - drift_id: "dignity_collapse_drift"
        label: "Dignity collapse (D-constraint failure under Ω/Θ)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Prolonged lock-in pressure can convert into shaming/ranking of the high-exposure role
          ('why can’t you just...'), or dehumanizing compression of affected parties.
      - drift_id: "sigma_incompatibility_clash"
        label: "Σ-incompatibility (integration clash)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          'Fixes' that assume symmetric χ fail; competing integration spines persist while the χ regime
          remains asymmetric.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      CONFLICT makes the drift corridor explicit: asymmetry is not only 'unequal power' but unequal
      stop-capability under time and exposure. It adds finite signatures for (i) χ priced asymmetrically,
      (ii) exposure capture of Φ, and (iii) stabilized attractor reproduction—blocking collapse into
      person blame or purity narratives.

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Harm/penalty exposure concentrates on the high-exposure role; timing/record control concentrates on
      the low-exposure role or the procedural layer. Observers may amplify exposure while bearing low cost.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Repeated cycles increase irreversibility for the high-exposure role; waiting raises exit costs.
      Time windows and deadlines function as Θ-compression that privileges the low-exposure role’s pacing.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Missing acknowledgments, missing correction/protection, and delayed responses accumulate as residues.
      These absences become load-bearing and can operate as control channels under Ω/Θ.

  rational_response_envelope:

      - "Maintain Χ as analytic guardrail: block urgency-as-proof and verdict fusion."
      - "Use Φ to inspect production conditions (who sets windows, penalties, escalation paths) rather than prosecute."
      - "Treat Σ as constrained: integration attempts are limited if χ remains asymmetrically priced."
      - "Preserve D: avoid shaming/ranking; avoid dehumanizing compression; refuse reputational enforcement drift."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Lock-in pressure invites shaming and pseudo-symmetry laundering: the high-exposure role is blamed for
      not pausing calmly, while the regime prices pause asymmetrically. Affected parties may be reduced to
      'cost factors' to justify continued asymmetry.
    structural_indicator: >
      Χ collapses into privilege; Φ becomes prosecutable; Σ demanded as compliance proof; Ψ externalized as
      moral compulsion; reversibility collapses under Θ/Ω with durable records; exposure capture escalates.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No claim about motives, traits, or moral worth of any party."
      - "No authorization for sanctions, governance, or reputational enforcement."
      - "No guarantee of resolution methods; no intervention script."
      - "No claim that formal availability of exit/appeal implies fairness."
    claimed:
      - "Asymmetry lock-in is a regime where χ (distance/stop-capability) is priced asymmetrically under Ω/Θ."
      - "Temporal repetition (Θ) and patterned reproduction (Α) stabilize who can pause, appeal, or exit."
      - "Λ residues (missing correction/acknowledgment) become load-bearing and can function as leverage channels."
      - "Under exposure, Φ predictably drifts into pressure unless bounded by Χ + reversibility + D."
      - "Σ can be locally coherent yet fail to change the regime if χ remains asymmetrically priced."
    misuse_warning: >
      High misuse risk when asymmetry lock-in talk is converted into blame, purity tests, or public prosecution.
      Under high publicness/durable records, require explicit mode/publicness/misuse declarations—or refuse transfer.

  structural_closure: >
    Asymmetry lock-in names a regime in which stopping/pausing/appealing (Χ) is structurally available but
    priced differently across roles (Ω), and time (Θ) turns this differential into durable lock-in. Non-events
    (Λ) such as missing correction and delayed acknowledgment accumulate as residues that stabilize the pattern
    (Α). Recontextualization (Φ) can expose production conditions but drifts into enforcement under exposure.
    PMS–CONFLICT closes the case by producing finite legibility of χ-pricing as a conflict-stabilizing mechanism,
    while blocking conversion into person-level verdicts or enforcement authority.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Asymmetry lock-in happens when “taking a step back” isn’t equally possible. One side can pause, delay, or
    exit with little penalty, while the other side pays heavily for the same move. Over time, that difference
    hardens the situation: delays and missing responses become leverage, and attempts to explain the structure
    can get punished. This case maps the pattern structurally and sets guardrails so it doesn’t turn into
    blame, shaming, or public enforcement.
