        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can describe framed inquiry (□), closure pressure (∇),
          non-closure (Λ), and the formation of stable interpretive habits (Α),
          as well as integration (Σ). It does not by itself formalize the
          logic-level failure mode where integration (Σ) is treated as final
          closure and is used to deny Λ, immunize against Φ-updates, and launder
          authority through “coherence.” The LOGIC overlay makes visible the
          boundary-managed alternative (□ ∘ Λ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ) and provides the drift
          class “dogmatism_sigma_totalization” as an operator distortion rather
          than a person-level diagnosis.

  scene_packet:
    scene_id: "Closure dispute where a coherent system is treated as final truth"
    context: >
      A discourse setting (philosophy, ideology, science-adjacent debate,
      institutional doctrine, online discourse) where a coherent explanatory
      system or worldview is presented as the last word. Challenges are
      reinterpreted as misunderstandings or illegitimate questions, and
      the configuration treats “being coherent” as the decisive closure event.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Inquiry framed as requiring final closure: the system must be complete,
        contradiction-free, and universally applicable, and coherence is treated
        as sufficient for authority (□).
      protected_constraints:
        - "Coherence/integration (Σ) is a coordination achievement, not a finality guarantee."
        - "Non-closure (Λ) can persist structurally even under strong Σ."
        - "Distance (Χ) must remain available to prevent coherence from becoming authority."
        - "Reversibility: any reading remains scene-bound and revisable under Φ."
        - "Frame discipline (□): claims must remain scoped to what the frame can warrant."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Personality or clinical labeling (e.g., calling someone 'dogmatic' as a trait)."
        - "Attributing motives, fear, or bad faith as the core explanation."
        - "Moral ranking of camps or 'who is rational/better'."
        - "Prescriptive enforcement rules (how to punish, exclude, or compel)."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "Hours to decades (debate cycles to long-lived doctrines)."
      iteration_rhythm: >
        Repeated cycles of challenge → rebuttal → re-assertion of system closure,
        with periodic escalation when boundary cases accumulate.
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "Canonization of core propositions (Α + Θ)."
        - "Ritualized argument templates and stock refutations (Α)."
        - "Institutional reinforcement (curricula, party lines, gatekeeping) (Ψ + Θ)."
      reversibility_window: >
        Medium to high while Φ-updates are permitted (new evidence, new contexts,
        explicit scope limits); low once the system is bound as identity or policy
        (Ψ + Θ lock-in).
    roles:
      - role_label: "R1: System-integrator"
        function: "Produces and maintains coherent synthesis (Σ) within the frame (□)."
        exposure_profile: >
          Exposed when Λ-residue is denied and reappears as accumulating anomalies,
          scope breaks, or contradiction management costs.
        notes: "Role is structural; not a person judgment."
      - role_label: "R2: Challenger / boundary-case introducer"
        function: "Brings Φ-shifts (new contexts) and highlights Λ-residue."
        exposure_profile: >
          Bears social/institutional costs if challenges are reframed as illegitimate
          under an Ω gradient.
        notes: "May be cast as 'confused' when Σ is totalized."
      - role_label: "R3: Audience / downstream users"
        function: "Acts on the system’s closure claims (Σ→E) and inherits mismatch fallout under Θ."
        exposure_profile: "Carries costs when the system’s scope breaks after lock-in."
        notes: "Downstream exposure increases with policy or high-stakes application."
      - role_label: "R4: Gatekeeper (optional)"
        function: "Certifies what counts as legitimate questions/answers (□ control)."
        exposure_profile: "Can shift exposure downward by suppressing Χ/Φ and declaring closure."
        notes: "Where present, Ω inflation risk rises."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Difference between (i) coherence as workable coordination (Σ) and
      (ii) coherence as final truth/authority (Σ-totalization), and between
      carrying Λ vs denying Λ.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Closure drive to end contestation: treat the integrated system as complete
      and immunize it against further revision, reframing all remainder as error.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "No final event occurs that removes remainder (Λ) across all contexts."
      - "No finite coherence proof yields universal scope without importing frame assumptions (□)."
      - "No last recontextualization (Φ) arrives that ends boundary cases."

  operator_mapping:
    operator_chain: ["Ψ", "Σ", "Χ", "Φ", "Θ", "Ω", "Α", "Λ", "□", "∇", "Δ"]
    reduced_signature: "Δ ∘ ∇ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α  +  (Σ-totalization drift: Σ ⇢ 'closure')"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        The frame (□) defines closure as completeness and treats coherence as sufficient.
        Scope limits are blurred or denied.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Authority gradients appear when closure claims are used to delegitimize questions
        and shift revision costs to challengers or downstream users.
      theta_temporality: >
        Over time (Θ), accumulated anomalies and new contexts raise the cost of denial.
        Lock-in turns revision into crisis management.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ is present as structured remainder (regress, anomalies, plural interpretations),
        but is denied or re-described as illegitimate rather than carried.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Stable habits form around stock defenses, boundary policing, and repetition of
        core propositions; the posture becomes self-reinforcing (Α).
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ-events (new evidence, domain shifts) are absorbed by ad hoc patches or excluded.
        Genuine scope revision is resisted.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ is forced into total closure: coherence is treated as truth, and contradictions
        are managed by immunization rather than coordination.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ appears when the system becomes identity, doctrine, or institutional policy,
        making revision costly and socially threatening.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ is suppressed or performative: reflection is replaced by reassertion of closure,
        blocking recognition of limits and remainder.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signatures are shorthand. In PMS, Σ depends on Χ and Φ; when Χ/Φ are
      suppressed, “Σ-totalization” is not legitimate integration but a distortion that
      denies prerequisites and treats coherence as authority.

        title: "Logical boundary management"
        formula: "□ ∘ Λ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          This is the non-drift alternative: hold Λ explicitly inside the frame (□),
          keep Χ available, and treat Σ as coordination rather than finality.
      - signature_id: "NON_CLOSURE_stability"
        title: "Sustainable non-closure"
        formula: "Δ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Explains why closure pressure can stabilize as an attractor (Α): repeated
          cycles of boundary challenge (Δ/Λ) and defensive framing (□) become habitual.
      - signature_id: "PRE_MORAL_justification"
        title: "Pre-moral justification"
        formula: "Δ ∘ ∇ ∘ □ ∘ Λ ∘ Α"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Locates the closure drive as a structural impulse (∇) within framed inquiry (□),
          stabilizing as practice (Α) without importing moral verdicts.
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "dogmatism_sigma_totalization"
        label: "Dogmatism (Σ-totalization)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          The situation explicitly treats coherence as closure and denies Λ; immune
          responses to Φ are rewarded as “consistency.”
      - drift_id: "technocratic_reduction_frame_overconstraint"
        label: "Technocratic reduction (□-overconstraint)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          The inquiry frame is treated as exhaustive reality; what lies outside is
          dismissed rather than recognized as out-of-frame or Λ remainder.
      - drift_id: "authority_capture_omega_inflation"
        label: "Authority capture (Ω-inflation)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Closure claims justify gatekeeping, delegitimization of questions, and
          certification-based truth (“settled because decided”).
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      The overlay isolates the failure mode as a logical distortion: Σ is converted from
      coordination into closure authority, which suppresses Χ/Φ and denies Λ. It clarifies
      the non-drift signature (□ ∘ Λ ∘ Χ ∘ Σ) as the disciplined alternative and keeps the
      analysis structural (no psychologizing, no moral ranking).

  drift_classification:
    drift_present: true
    drift_label: "dogmatism_sigma_totalization"
    minimal_drift_signature: "□ ∘ (Λ denied) ∘ (Χ suppressed) ∘ Σ⇢closure  (+ Ψ lock-in when institutionalized)"
    observable_markers:
      - "Immunization against revision: counterexamples reclassified as misunderstandings or exceptions."
      - "Scope creep: the system claims universality beyond its warranted frame (□ overflow)."
      - "Remainder denial: Λ is treated as error, incompetence, or illegitimate questioning."
      - "Performative distance: Χ replaced by repetition of conclusions."
      - "Patchwork recontextualization: Φ handled only via ad hoc patches without scope revision."

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Where closure is enforced, challengers and downstream users carry revision and error
      costs, while gatekeepers/system-maintainers externalize uncertainty.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Over time, the cost of reversal grows: doctrine, infrastructure, and identity-binding
      (Ψ) make Φ-updates socially and institutionally expensive.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      Residue accumulates: anomalies, contradictions, and boundary cases recur and intensify,
      often resurfacing as crisis rather than as revisable remainder.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Make the operative frame (□) explicit and scope claims to what it can warrant."
      - "Carry Λ explicitly: treat remainder as structural boundary, not as defect."
      - "Keep Χ available: distinguish coherence from authority; suspend closure impulses."
      - "Use Φ for genuine scope revision when contexts change rather than ad hoc immunization."
      - "Treat Σ as coordination: allow plural integrations where frames differ, without totalization."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Dogmatism turns discourse into humiliation or exclusion: dissent is framed as
      incompetence, and closure becomes a power tool under Ω.
    structural_indicator: >
      Λ denial + Χ suppression + Ω inflation: questions are delegitimized, gatekeeping rises,
      and identity/authority substitutes for boundary discipline.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "A diagnosis of individuals or groups as 'dogmatic' in a trait sense."
      - "A moral ranking of positions or a prescription to punish/exclude."
      - "A claim that coherence is bad; Σ remains valuable as coordination."
    claimed:
      - "Σ-totalization is a structural drift where coherence is treated as final closure and Λ is denied."
      - "This drift suppresses Χ and blocks Φ-updates, increasing brittleness under Θ."
      - "LOGIC discipline is to manage boundaries (□) by carrying Λ with Χ while using Σ for coordination."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use this case as a rhetorical weapon to disqualify opponents or to assert
      superiority. It is a structural mapping of a failure mode, not a verdict.

  structural_closure: >
    Σ-totalization (dogmatism) is the drift in which integration is converted into
    closure authority: coherence is treated as truth, and structured remainder (Λ) is
    denied rather than carried. This produces short-term stability (Α) and often
    institutional lock-in (Ψ) but becomes brittle under time (Θ) as Φ-recontextualizations
    accumulate. PMS–LOGIC reorients the configuration toward boundary-managed non-closure:
    keep the frame explicit (□), carry Λ, maintain Χ, and use Σ as coordination rather than finality.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Dogmatism here means something specific: a coherent system is treated as the final
    answer, so anything that doesn’t fit is dismissed instead of taken as a real limit or
    an open remainder. That can feel stable, because the system stays consistent, but it
    becomes fragile over time as new cases pile up. PMS–LOGIC describes a safer structure:
    be clear about the context a theory applies to, admit what it can’t settle, keep room
    for reflection, and use coherence to coordinate—not to claim final authority.
