    context: >
      A freedom claim is demanded: an agent, system, or role is said to be "free"
      (or "not free") in a practical sense. The dispute is not about metaphysical
      indeterminism, but about how degrees of option-space, constraint, reversibility,
      and self-binding are produced, stabilized, contested, and sometimes enforced
      within frames (□). PMS treats freedom here as a structural property of
      praxeological configuration: available alternatives (Δ/□), constraint patterns
      (Α/Ω), trajectory horizons (Θ), recontextualization capacity (Φ), reflective
      distance (Χ), integrative coherence (Σ), and legitimate self-binding (Ψ).
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Freedom is scoped as practical option-space and constraint-navigation inside
        declared frames (□): e.g., legal freedom (rights/permissions), institutional
        freedom (discretion latitude), relational freedom (negotiability of roles),
        technical freedom (degrees of control), or agent-architecture freedom
        (policy flexibility under constraints). Outputs are bounded:
        "within this frame, this configuration affords X degrees of freedom"
        vs "underdetermined / contested (Λ)".
      protected_constraints:
        - "No metaphysical proof of free will or indeterminism is claimed."
        - "Freedom claims must declare the frame (□) and the relevant constraint set (rules, material limits, obligations, dependencies)."
        - "Freedom is not inferred as a person-essence; it is mapped as a scene/role configuration."
        - "Reversibility discipline applies: freedom readings are revisable under recontextualization (Φ) and under Λ (missing constraints, hidden dependencies, unobserved options)."
        - "Dignity-in-practice (D) constrains how freedom language is used under asymmetry (Ω) (no coercive 'you are free, therefore...' verdicts; no stripping standing via 'not free')."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Metaphysical doctrines of ultimate free will vs ultimate determinism."
        - "Phenomenology of 'felt freedom' as evidence or refutation."
        - "Moral ranking or blame attribution derived from 'freedom level'."
        - "Enforcement guidance for institutions or punitive prescriptions."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "Option-spaces unfold over trajectories (Θ): short-horizon choices and long-horizon commitments and exits."
      iteration_rhythm: "Cycles of constraint encounter: perceive options → attempt → meet limits → reframe → revise commitments → restabilize."
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "records, contracts, and institutional memory that stabilize permissions and constraints (□/Θ)"
        - "habitual constraint-navigation scripts and default choices (Α)"
        - "policies, role duties, and promises that bind discretion over time (Σ→Ψ when formalized or legitimately self-bound)"
      reversibility_window: >
        Freedom assessments remain revisable while frames admit renegotiation (Φ),
        while constraints and options remain partially unknown (Λ), and while binding
        has not fixed obligations or exit costs (Ψ). Where binding exists
        (contract, duty, policy, promise), revision requires explicit re-integration (Σ)
        and re-authorization within the frame (□); some bindings are intentionally costly.
    roles:
      - role_label: "Option-bearer (enacting role)"
        function: "Navigates alternatives, constraints, and commitments within the frame; bears opportunity and constraint costs."
        exposure_profile: "High; exposed to Ω-driven constraint imposition and Θ lock-in from commitments."
        notes: "Not evaluated; treated as structurally exposed to option-space and exit costs."
      - role_label: "Constraint-setter (institution / authority / platform)"
        function: "Defines, enforces, or modulates constraint regimes (permissions, prohibitions, resource access, deadlines)."
        exposure_profile: "High leverage, lower exposure; can externalize costs down Ω gradients."
        notes: "Represents Ω gradients shaping which options are real, affordable, or contestable."
      - role_label: "Interpreter / claimant (freedom narrator)"
        function: "Asserts or disputes 'freedom' status for coordination, legitimacy, responsibility, or policy decisions."
        exposure_profile: "Medium; exposed to contestation over frame selection and hidden constraints."
        notes: "Must keep □ explicit and preserve Λ; avoid freedom→desert slides."
      - role_label: "Mediator / integrator (negotiation role)"
        function: "Attempts Σ integration of competing constraints and options (trade-offs, role renegotiation, policy redesign)."
        exposure_profile: "Medium; exposed to feasibility limits and to Ψ costs of binding outcomes."
        notes: "Operates where Φ (reframing) and Σ (integration) are structurally expensive but necessary."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Alternatives become legible: allowed vs forbidden, feasible vs infeasible,
      reversible vs irreversible, exit vs lock-in. Δ sharpens an option-space and
      invites claims about "having a choice."
    nabla_impulse: >
      Closure pressure to settle status: declare "free" (responsible, legitimate,
      self-authoring) or "not free" (excused, constrained, externally caused),
      often under urgency, contest, or institutional demand. ∇ compresses graded
      constraint structures into binary labels.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "Expected explicit permission/constraint clarity does not arrive (unclear rules, opaque enforcement, hidden dependencies)."
      - "Expected viable exit option does not exist (high switching costs, retaliation risk, sunk costs, non-portable commitments)."
      - "Expected negotiation/revision channel does not occur (no appeal path, no Φ opportunity, delayed or absent re-authorization)."

    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        Freedom is produced inside a declared □: what counts as an option, a constraint,
        an acceptable trade-off, and a legitimate exit depends on the frame
        (legal, institutional, relational, technical, architectural). "Free" is not
        a global property; it is a scoped claim.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Ω shapes real option-space: constraint-setters can expand or contract discretion;
        exposed roles bear the cost of constraint, surveillance, sanctions, or dependency.
        Ω gradients can convert nominal permission into practically unavailable options.
      theta_temporality: >
        Freedom is Θ-structured: options depend on horizon, cadence, delay, accumulation,
        and lock-in. Short-term discretion may coexist with long-term Θ constraints and
        sunk-cost trajectories.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ persists as hidden constraints, opaque enforcement, unknown alternatives,
        and counterfactual opacity ("what would have happened if..."). PMS preserves Λ
        rather than laundering freedom into certainty.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Α stabilizes default choices and constraint-navigation scripts: routines, learned
        compliance, or habitual exits can make option-space appear smaller or larger than
        it is under the frame; scripts can dominate even when alternatives exist.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ shifts the freedom question by embedding it into another frame:
        discretion → liability, permission → legitimacy, autonomy → safety, choice → coercion.
        Φ changes what counts as a meaningful alternative.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ integrates competing constraints and goals into coherent actionable packages
        (trade-offs, negotiated role terms, redesigned processes). Σ supports practical
        freedom without metaphysical claims.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ binds freedom through commitments: promises, contracts, role duties, policies.
        Binding can reduce local option-space while increasing long-horizon agency and
        responsibility; Ψ is structurally expensive and requires Χ + reversibility discipline.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ prevents binary status collapse and coercive "you are free/not free" verdicts;
        keeps freedom claims scene-bound, graded, and revisable—especially under Ω.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Common hygiene failure: jumping from Δ/∇ ("there is / isn't a choice") directly to Ψ
      (binding responsibility, blame, or legitimacy) without specifying □ (which freedom),
      without preserving Λ (hidden constraints), without tracking Φ (frame shift into liability
      or legitimacy), and without performing Σ under Χ. Valid PMS application keeps freedom
      as a structural, graded, frame-bound map with explicit reversibility.

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Constraint-setters can define permissions, surveillance, sanctions, and contest channels,
      while option-bearers carry practical costs (time, risk, dependency, retaliation, loss).
      Nominal freedoms can be hollow under Ω when exit options are costly or contest capacity is low.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Freedom claims can harden over time into durable doctrines ("fully free" / "not free") and
      into binding commitments (contracts, duties, identity commitments). Early closure produces
      path dependence and makes later revision expensive.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      High in complex scenes: unobserved alternatives, hidden constraints, strategic opacity,
      and counterfactual uncertainty persist even when decisions must be made.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Declare the frame (□): legal / institutional / relational / technical freedom, and the decision purpose."
      - "Map option-space as graded (Δ) under explicit constraints, not as a binary status label."
      - "Make Θ explicit: horizon, exit costs, lock-in, and what is reversible when."
      - "Make Λ explicit (hidden constraints, opaque enforcement, unknown options) instead of forcing certainty."
      - "Track Φ when the freedom question shifts (discretion → liability; autonomy → safety; choice → coercion)."
      - "Use Σ to integrate trade-offs and redesign constraints where operational freedom is needed."
      - "Apply Χ to resist coercive freedom-as-verdict under Ω; keep reversibility live unless Ψ is legitimate."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Freedom language is weaponized under asymmetry: "you are free" is used to impose blame,
      deny support, or force compliance; "you are not free" is used to strip standing, justify
      paternalism, or foreclose contest.
    structural_indicator: >
      Ψ-hardening without Χ: a freedom status becomes a binding verdict; Λ is suppressed; Φ shifts
      are ignored; alternative Σ-integrations are disallowed; costs are externalized down Ω gradients.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No metaphysical proof of free will, indeterminism, or ultimate self-causation is provided."
      - "No binary verdict that an agent/system is 'truly free' or 'truly unfree' in all frames is claimed."
      - "No moral ranking, blame allocation, or person-level essence inference is derived from freedom language."
      - "No enforcement or governance guidance is provided."
    claimed:
      - "Freedom is modeled as a frame-bound (□), graded option-space and constraint-navigation structure shaped by Α, Ω, and Θ."
      - "Λ residues (hidden constraints, unknown alternatives, counterfactual opacity) are preserved as structural outputs and must remain explicit."
      - "Φ shifts freedom meaning across frames; Χ supports reflective non-coercive assessment; Σ integrates trade-offs; Ψ explains how commitments bind and reshape freedom over time."
      - "Χ + reversibility + D constrain freedom talk under Ω."
    misuse_warning: >
      Do not use this case to weaponize freedom status ("free/not free") for coercion, denial of standing,
      or irreversible labeling. Outputs are structural descriptions of option-space and constraints within
      frames, not verdicts about persons.

  structural_closure: >
    PMS reframes non-metaphysical freedom as a structural configuration: Δ makes alternatives legible; ∇ pressures
    binary closure; □ defines what counts as an option and a constraint; Λ marks hidden constraints and unknown
    counterfactuals; Α stabilizes navigation scripts; Ω shapes who can impose constraints and who bears costs; Θ
    determines horizons, lock-in, and exit costs; Φ shifts the freedom question across frames; Σ integrates trade-offs
    into coherent packages; Ψ binds commitments that can both constrain local discretion and enable long-horizon agency.
    Where closure exceeds frame warrant, Λ remains explicit.
  plain_language_summary: >
    This case treats "freedom" as a practical structure, not a metaphysical mystery. Whether someone is free depends on
    the context: what options are real, what constraints apply, how costly it is to exit or revise commitments, and who
    has power to enforce rules. We often feel pressure to label situations as simply free or not free, but hidden constraints
    and unknown alternatives remain. The aim is to keep freedom claims explicit about scope and limits, revisable under new
    framing or evidence, and non-coercive—especially when power differences shape who pays the price of "choice."
