        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can describe constraint, non-events (Λ), temporality (Θ), asymmetry (Ω),
          integration attempts (Σ), distance (Χ), and binding (Ψ). But PMS core alone does not
          explicitly formalize the terminal regime where (i) harm and loss remain structurally
          unavoidable, (ii) multiple locally coherent bindings collide (Ψ-collision), and (iii)
          any demand for a “solution” functions as coercive closure (Σ-as-verdict) rather than
          viable reintegration. The CONFLICT overlay supplies terminal-positioning vocabulary,
          reduced signatures, and drift classes that keep tragedy legible without converting it
          into blame, diagnosis, or governance authority.

  scene_packet:
    scene_id: "TRAG-001"
    context: >
      A situation contains incompatible obligations, constraints, or commitments such that any
      available continuation produces real loss. Actors may be competent, reflective, and
      dignity-constrained, yet outcomes still include harm, sacrifice, or irreversible cost.
      The scene invites moralization (“someone must be at fault”) or solution-demand (“there
      must be a way”), even though the structure is one of non-eliminable remainder.
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Structural legibility of unavoidable remainder: tragedy is treated as a category of
        praxis-structure where non-eliminable loss persists under time, asymmetry, and binding.
        The analysis does not adjudicate moral rightness, does not assign guilt, and does not
        authorize enforcement.
      protected_constraints:
        - "Scene-bound claims only; no global labels or essence claims (reversibility)."
        - "Maintain distance (Χ): no fusion into verdict, urgency, or authority claims."
        - "Dignity-in-practice constrains language: no shaming, ranking, humiliation."
        - "Do not convert descriptive outputs into governance, sanction, or selection logic."
        - "Keep explicit that tragedy can persist under mature praxis (no 'maturity fixes tragedy')."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Psychological diagnosis, motive inference, personality typing."
        - "Moral prosecution as closure device ('someone must be bad')."
        - "Guaranteed resolution methods, intervention scripts, or toolkits."
        - "Policy/legal guidance or institutional enforcement without explicit mode shift."
        - "Public sorting/selection based on who is 'tragic' or 'responsible'."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "mid-to-long (weeks to years; sometimes acute decision points with long shadow)"
      iteration_rhythm: "episodic; decision points recur with accumulating residue"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "Durable consequences and path dependence (Θ-hardening)"
        - "Ongoing obligations/roles (Ψ persistence)"
        - "Records/reputation/publicness coupling (optional; amplifies Ω/Θ)"
        - "Repeated non-events (Λ) that remain load-bearing (no repair/relief event arrives)"
      reversibility_window: >
        Typically narrowing: early moves may remain revisable; later stages harden via Θ and
        Ω exposure. Some reframing (Φ) is possible, but it cannot eliminate remainder if the
        binding collision and constraints remain.
    roles:
      - role_label: "R1: Primary agent / decision-bearer"
        function: "Holds binding commitments; must choose under constraints; carries attribution exposure."
        exposure_profile: "Ω: high attribution / liability; may face asymmetric blame pressure."
        notes: "Not a person-type; a structural role position."
      - role_label: "R2: Affected parties / dependents"
        function: "Bear harm exposure; limited control over constraints; may be unevenly protected."
        exposure_profile: "Ω: high vulnerability; low control; may lack access to Χ."
        notes: "Do not compress into units; preserve D constraints."
      - role_label: "R3: Observers / institutions (optional)"
        function: "Interpret outcomes; can amplify exposure; can harden narratives into durable records."
        exposure_profile: "Ω: narrative power without proportional harm exposure."
        notes: "High misuse gradient if analysis travels publicly."
      - role_label: "R4: Constraint-setter / environment (optional)"
        function: "Defines constraints; shapes option space; may be implicit (systemic) rather than intentional."
        exposure_profile: "Ω: often low exposure; high structural influence."
        notes: "Avoid intent attribution; treat as structural condition."

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      A difference becomes legible between (i) mutually exclusive obligations or values, and
      (ii) possible continuations that each preserve one binding while violating another.
    nabla_impulse: >
      Strong closure pressure to remove remainder: demand for a clean solution, a culprit, a
      single narrative, or a morally pure action—often amplified by publicness, urgency, or
      institutional timelines.
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "A non-harmful option does not exist within the frame."
      - "A repair/relief event does not arrive (forgiveness, rescue, reversibility)."
      - "A clarifying authority or decisive information does not appear in time."
      - "A symmetric pause/timeout (Χ) is not socially or institutionally granted."

    reduced_signature: "Σ ∘ Ψ ∘ Ω ∘ Θ ∘ Χ  (tragedy core: binding persists; time/exposure harden; distance is pressured; integration cannot remove remainder)"
    operator_notes:
      frame_box: >
        Tragedy is treated as a frame category: the situation is structured such that remainder
        persists. The frame blocks the conversion “remainder → blame → closure”.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Exposure gradients distribute harm and attribution unevenly: some bear the loss, others
        bear the blame, and observers may gain narrative control. Ω makes “responsibility talk”
        structurally volatile.
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ extends the dilemma into trajectories: path dependence narrows options; revision becomes
        costly; later reinterpretation cannot erase earlier losses.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ is constitutive: the absent clean option and absent relief events become the remainder
        that carries meaning and fuels closure demands.
      attractor_alpha: >
        Α can stabilize a “tragic loop”: repeated settlement demands, repeated blame cycles, or
        repeated attempts to narratively eliminate remainder (often via Φ substitution).
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ can soften or re-embed meanings (e.g., shifting from verdict to production-conditions),
        but under exposure it can drift into substitution: narrative that pretends remainder is resolved.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ may produce a coherent continuation, but not a remainder-free one. In tragedy, Σ is under
        load: integration cannot satisfy all bindings simultaneously; forced “perfect integration”
        becomes coercive closure.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ binds identity/commitment across time; collision of bindings (Ψ₁ excludes Ψ₂) can persist
        without moral failure. Attempts to externalize Ψ as imposed obligation invite misuse.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ is required to keep tragedy readable as structure (not verdict). Under Θ/Ω pressure,
        Χ is often delegitimized (“stop talking, decide”), increasing drift into blame/prosecution.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Reduced signatures are shorthand: PMS prerequisites remain authoritative (Χ depends on Φ/Θ/□;
      Σ depends on Χ/Φ; Ψ depends on Σ/Θ/Χ). Any use of Σ as instant moral proof (Σ without Χ),
      or Ψ as externalized compulsion, indicates drift and is invalid as PMS application.

        title: "CONFLICT terminal core (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Σ + Ψ + Ω + Θ + Χ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Tragedy is legible as terminal regime: binding persists, time and exposure harden,
          distance is pressured, and integration cannot eliminate remainder.
      - signature_id: "DRIFT_binding_collision"
        title: "Binding collision (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Ψ + Ω + Θ + Σ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Tragedy often includes colliding bindings that remain jointly non-viable under shared Θ;
          settlement demands try to force Σ as if collision could be erased.
      - signature_id: "DRIFT_exposure_capture"
        title: "Exposure capture (reduced signature)"
        formula: "Ω + Θ + Φ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Under publicness or institutional record coupling, reframing and nuance harden into
          verdict-objects; tragedy talk becomes reputational weaponry.
    drift_candidates:
      - drift_id: "binding_collision_drift"
        label: "Binding collision (Ψ-collision)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Multiple valid commitments cannot be jointly satisfied; persistence of Ψ keeps the system
          coupled even after a coherent continuation is chosen.
      - drift_id: "sigma_incompatibility_clash"
        label: "Σ-incompatibility (integration clash)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Locally coherent integration spines remain incompatible; forced “one story” converts
          tragedy into prosecution rather than legibility.
      - drift_id: "exposure_capture_drift"
        label: "Exposure capture (Φ under Ω/Θ with scaled publicness)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Public/institutional contexts punish revision; tragedy is re-written into blame narratives
          to satisfy closure demands.
      - drift_id: "dignity_collapse_drift"
        label: "Dignity collapse (D-constraint failure under Ω/Θ)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Under strong remainder and time pressure, language can drift into shaming/ranking and
          dehumanizing compression as substitute for integration.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      CONFLICT makes tragedy explicit as terminal-positioning: legibility without reintegration.
      It supplies drift markers that prevent the analysis from collapsing into moral sorting,
      “solution laundering,” or exposure-based enforcement.

  drift_classification:
    drift_present: true
    drift_label: "Tragic remainder under binding collision (terminal legibility; closure-demand drift risk)"
    minimal_drift_signature: "Ψ-collision + Θ-hardening + Ω exposure + Σ under load (+ Χ pressured)"
    observable_markers:
      - "Persistent remainder: every available continuation produces real loss."
      - "Escalating demands for a culprit or a single clean narrative."
      - "Distance/pausing (Χ) treated as illegitimate or punished."
      - "Reframing (Φ) used as prosecution/substitution rather than premise inspection."
      - "Moral ranking/shaming language appears as closure substitute (D stress)."

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Harm exposure and attribution exposure are unevenly distributed. Those bearing loss may have
      low control; those judged may have high liability; observers may have narrative power with
      low cost. Ω gradients predict closure-demand intensity and misuse risk.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Θ produces path dependence: early moves become irreversible; later revision cannot undo losses.
      Record coupling (if present) hardens trajectories and punishes clarification.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      The absent clean option (Λ) is constitutive; missing relief/repair events keep residue load-bearing.
      Residue fuels repeated closure attempts (blame, purity tests, forced verdicts).

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Name the frame: tragedy is remainder-bearing (□) rather than solvable by verdict."
      - "Maintain Χ: refuse fusion into moral proof or urgency-driven authority."
      - "Use Φ to shift from verdict-demand to production-conditions (what constraints generate the remainder)."
      - "Allow Σ to yield a coherent continuation without claiming remainder elimination."
      - "Keep Ψ explicit as self-binding (not externalized compulsion) to prevent coercive transfer."
      - "Make Ω gradients explicit (who bears harm, who bears blame, who holds narrative power)."
      - "Preserve D: no shaming, no dehumanizing compression, no reputational enforcement."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: >
      Under remainder and closure pressure, tragedy is converted into shame, ranking, or public prosecution,
      especially when observers control exposure and narratives.
    structural_indicator: >
      Χ collapses into urgency; Φ becomes verdict-hardening; Σ is demanded as purity proof; Ψ is externalized
      as imposed obligation; reversibility collapses under Θ/Ω.
    validity_reminder: >
      If used for shaming, ranking, coercion, or irreversible person claims, this violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "No claim of moral truth, correct outcome, or justified harm."
      - "No person-level evaluation, trait inference, or intent attribution."
      - "No promise of resolution; tragedy is not treated as a failure of maturity."
      - "No authorization for governance, sanction, or selection based on this analysis."
    claimed:
      - "Tragedy is a structural category: remainder can persist under mature praxis."
      - "Binding collisions (Ψ) under Θ and Ω can make full Σ-resolution structurally non-viable."
      - "Λ (absence of clean options/relief events) is constitutive, not accidental."
      - "Distance (Χ) is required to keep tragedy legible as structure rather than verdict."
      - "CONFLICT lens yields finite outputs: terminal legibility + boundary discipline, not solutions."
    misuse_warning: >
      High misuse risk if tragedy language is turned into blame allocation, reputational prosecution,
      or institutional enforcement. Under publicness/durable records, require explicit mode/publicness/misuse
      declarations or refuse transfer.

  structural_closure: >
    Tragedy-as-category closes when the analysis stabilizes remainder as structurally produced (Λ under □),
    temporally persistent (Θ), asymmetrically distributed (Ω), and binding-relevant (Ψ), while preserving Χ
    to prevent verdict fusion. The CONFLICT overlay positions this as terminal legibility: integration (Σ) can
    yield continuation but cannot erase remainder, and attempts to force remainder elimination drift into
    prosecution, shaming, or exposure capture.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Sometimes a situation stays painful even when people act responsibly. Tragedy, here, means the structure
    contains no clean option: any path causes real loss, and time and exposure make revision hard. The point
    is not to find someone to blame or to pretend the loss can be removed by a “right answer,” but to make
    the structure readable and keep the language from turning into shaming, sorting, or enforcement.
