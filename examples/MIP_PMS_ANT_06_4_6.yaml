    secondary_material: ""
    assumptions_and_inferences: |
      - Pattern-level structural reading (no concrete transcript, institution, or real-person case material provided).
      - MIPractice A/C/R/P are applied to enactments/roles inside decision, implementation, and downstream settings.
      - IA box is treated as a structural check: downstream-effect claims become IA-risk when they are used to authorize
        coercion or constraint without transparency about scope/criteria (T), without justification proportional to protected
        goods (J), without review windows (TB), and without usable correction/exit pathways (R).
      - Responsibility (M) is role- and constraint-dependent; no person-level attribution is intended.
    quality_and_limits:
      coverage_estimate: "medium"
      reliability_estimate: "medium"
      known_gaps:
        - "No concrete decision vignette/transcript; pattern-level only."
        - "No domain-specific criteria for justified downstream constraints (safety-critical vs discretionary)."
        - "No explicit mapping of actual review/appeal/exit pathways and their practical costs under Ω."
        - "No empirical base-rate data for frequency/severity of drift in specific institutions."
      main_bias_risks_here:
        - "frame_bias (treating downstream reasoning as inherently authority-laundering rather than condition-dependent)"
        - "selection_bias (using a paradigmatic description without counter-examples)"
        - "hindsight_bias (reading downstream harms as inevitable rather than contingent)"

  snapshot:
    short_case_description: |
      A decision is taken inside a bounded frame (□) but its effects propagate over time (Θ) and across roles and institutions (Ω),
      stabilizing routines and narratives (Α). Under uncertainty (Λ), downstream-effect reasoning can drift into prophecy or authority
      conversion: probability becomes mandate and foresight becomes entitlement to compel others. A viable stance keeps scope explicit (□),
      carries Λ as remainder, stays revisable (Φ), maintains stop-capability (Χ), integrates without totalization (Σ), and binds responsibility inward (Ψ).
    central_actors_and_roles:
      - "Decision-holder"
      - "Implementers"
      - "Affected parties"
      - "Third-party institutions (optional)"
    guiding_question: |
      Under what conditions does downstream-effect reasoning remain a bounded, uncertainty-aware stance (□ ∘ Λ ∘ Θ ∘ Χ, with Φ/Σ and inward Ψ),
      and under what conditions does it drift into prophecy/authority laundering (Λ-collapse, Χ erosion, Ψ externalization) under Ω and Θ lock-in?

    publicity_degree: "institutional"

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: |
      - Downstream effects propagate across Θ and are unevenly distributed under Ω.
      - Uncertainty persists (Λ): downstream chains are hypotheses, not settled future truth.
      - Α stabilization: routines and narratives harden around decisions, affecting later revisability.
      - Φ is structurally possible: revision can occur via new data/constraints/stakeholder visibility.
      - Validity gate requires Χ + reversibility + D (dignity constraints under Ω).
    variable_elements: |
      - Whether □ is explicit: scope, horizon, levers, evidence class, what is out of frame.
      - Whether review cycles exist and are meaningful (TB).
      - Whether correction/appeal/exit pathways are practically usable (R), including retaliation costs.
      - Whether Ω auditing is performed and affected parties participate in review (consulted/co-deciding).
      - Whether Σ integrates multiple channels (economic/social/technical) without totalization or single-metric dominance.
      - Whether Ψ remains inward (ownership + update discipline) or is externalized as obligation.
    unfair_high_M_zones: |
      - Affected parties with low frame-control and low exit options.
      - Implementers constrained by mandates, deadlines, or institutional coercion.
      - Situations with predictability≈0 or alternatives≈0 (crisis response; hard legal deadlines).
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: |
      - "The downstream consequences are clear" used to suppress Λ and skip review windows.
      - "The model/prediction says so" used to block Φ updates after context shifts.
      - "We had to act fast" used to avoid reversibility rights or contest/correction channels.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: |
        Decision-holders may know local levers and some evidence but not the full downstream chain; implementers have operational visibility
        into second-order effects; affected parties often have local impact knowledge but low frame access; third-party institutions may know
        policy constraints but can treat frame assumptions as self-evident.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: |
        Φ signals can appear via monitoring, dashboards, incident reports, stakeholder feedback, or implementer anomalies, but can be discounted
        when ∇ closure pressure or legitimacy narratives dominate.
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: |
        Confusing downstream hypothesis with warrant; treating probability as authorization; role confusion between risk-management and entitlement;
        underweighting lived constraints of low-exit roles under Ω.
    coherence:
      official_narratives: |
        "We foresee downstream harms; therefore we must act now. Delay is irresponsible. The data show the direction."
      visible_enactments: |
        Decisions coupled to predictive narratives; compliance demands justified by anticipated effects; resistance to revision after sunk costs;
        stabilization of routines and reporting frames (Α) that can suppress Φ.
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: |
        Narrative coherence can be high (“responsible foresight”), while operational coherence breaks occur when contexts shift and
        revision pathways are missing—forcing crisis-driven change rather than steady updating.
    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: |
        - Declaring scope/horizon/evidence class (□ discipline).
        - Keeping Λ explicit and separating assessment from authorization (Λ + Χ discipline).
        - Designing review cycles and update triggers (TB + Φ).
        - Ensuring usable correction/appeal/exit pathways and low retaliation costs (R).
        - Auditing Ω exposure and protecting those who bear downstream burdens (D constraint).
        - Binding responsibility inward (Ψ): ownership + update discipline without externalized obligation.
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: |
        In drift variants, responsibility is redefined as decisiveness (“we acted”) while uncertainty and costs are shifted outward
        (“they must comply”), especially onto low-exit roles under Ω.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: |
        Short-term coordination gains may occur, but long-term mismatch costs arise when lock-in prevents correction. Downstream actors inherit
        constraints and burdens under Θ and may be exposed to dignity violations when prediction is used as mandate.
    power:
      formal_power_distribution: |
        Decision-holders and institutions often control policy levers, access, certification, and enforcement. Third-party institutions can
        scale consequences and harden frames.
      factual_power_distribution: |
        Narrative and agenda-setting power can force early binding; predictive rhetoric can produce compliance dynamics; monitoring regimes can
        amplify asymmetry in who is seen, constrained, or excluded.
      used_alternatives: |
        - Predictive narratives to justify constraint
        - Standard-setting and institutional embedding to stabilize consequences
        - Compliance demands framed as responsibility
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: |
        - Explicit uncertainty budgets / remainder registers (Λ)
        - Clear separation between prediction and authorization (Χ)
        - Protected dissent/appeal channels with low retaliation cost (R)
        - Participatory impact auditing with affected parties (Ω + D)
        - Formal review cycles with meaningful update triggers (TB + Φ)
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: |
        D module remains OFF. Dignity risks are handled structurally: the main risk is coercion, humiliation, exclusion, or surveillance
        justified by downstream-effect narratives under Ω, especially when correction/exit channels are weak.

  ia_protection:
    transparency_measures: |
      - Make the operative frame explicit (□): scope, horizon, levers, evidence class, and what is out of frame.
      - Keep Λ explicit: uncertainty budgets and remainder registers; prohibit guarantee/inevitability language as warrant substitute.
      - Separate prediction from authorization; document decision criteria, limits, and why constraints (if any) are proportional.
    time_bound_measures: |
      - Introduce formal review cycles/sunset clauses proportional to reach and lock-in (Θ).
      - Use staged commitments with explicit re-evaluation checkpoints and downgrade paths.
    reversibility_measures: |
      - Maintain usable correction/appeal/exit pathways with low retaliation cost (R).
      - Ensure implementers can raise Φ signals without penalty (protected reporting channels).

        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 4–9/10 (where embedding/enforcement was designed and maintained)"
    course_in_words: |
      The pattern often moves from bounded impact hypotheses toward stabilized routines and narratives that treat downstream chains as settled.
      Over time, Φ shifts and edge cases accumulate; where review/correction pathways are missing or priced out, updates occur mainly through crisis.
      Where scope, uncertainty budgets, timed review, and usable exits exist, the trajectory can stabilize without prophecy/authority laundering.
    responsibility_viability_range: |
      Viability increases when □, Λ budgeting, TB review cycles, and R correction rights are explicit and usable; it collapses when prediction
      is laundered into entitlement and reversibility is priced out under Ω and Θ.

  open_questions_and_blind_spots:
    unclear_points: |
      - Which concrete domain is intended (policy, algorithmic gating, infrastructure, organisational decisions)?
      - What protected goods and decision criteria justify constraints (if any) derived from downstream reasoning?
      - What review windows, exits, and correction pathways exist—and what are their real costs under Ω?
    missing_data_or_perspectives: |
      - Concrete vignette/transcript showing how downstream reasoning is communicated and operationalized.
      - Evidence-chain details: what signals were available, what was treated in/out of frame.
      - Downstream distribution mapping: who bears costs, who has exits, who can trigger revision (Φ).
    distortion_risks: |
      - Conflating legitimate risk-management with authority laundering.
      - Underweighting tragedy clause: some downstream harm is collision of goods, not maturity failure.
      - Overgeneralizing from a template description without counter-examples.

  biases_case_level:
    initial_intuition: |
      Downstream-effect reasoning invites authority conversion because it can borrow legitimacy from “responsibility for the future.”
      This intuition must be checked against domain-specific justification and the presence of review/exit design.
    named_bias_risks:
      - "confirmation_bias"
      - "hindsight_bias"
      - "status_quo_bias"
      - "halo_effect"
    counter_reading_outline: |
      Counter-reading: downstream-effect reasoning can be a mature stewardship practice in complex systems (safety, infrastructure,
      public health) when it stays explicit about Λ, remains revisable via Φ, is time-bounded by TB review cycles, keeps Χ active,
      and preserves R correction rights. The decisive variable is not “talking about consequences,” but whether consequence talk is
      used as non-authorizing hypothesis work or as a mandate that suppresses contestability.

  analyst_reflection:
    self_implication_notes: |
      Naming “authority laundering” can itself become a rhetorical weapon in institutional disputes. This file therefore treats the
      phenomenon structurally and foregrounds scope, uncertainty budgeting, review cycles, correction rights, and dignity constraints,
      rather than attributing motives or defects to people.
    possible_next_steps: |
      - Add a concrete vignette and map roles, constraints, enforcement moves, and Φ update signals explicitly.
      - Convert IA protections into a minimal checklist: scope statement, uncertainty budget, review cycle, appeal/exit path, affected-party consultation.
      - Provide 1–2 counter-examples of justified downstream constraints with safeguards (T/J/TB/R) and show how Χ is preserved.

    title: "Praxeological analysis of a practice pattern: Downstream effects reasoning under uncertainty and propagation"
    one_paragraph_overview: |
      This reading describes a structural pattern where decisions made inside a bounded frame produce effects that propagate across time and institutions.
      Because downstream chains are complex, uncertainty remains active and cannot be replaced by guarantees. The main drift risk is turning “likely consequences”
      into a mandate that compels others, especially when power and exit options are unevenly distributed. The main protections are explicit scope, explicit uncertainty
      budgeting, timed review cycles, usable correction or exit pathways, and participation of those most affected. The core concern is not “never act,” but preventing
      downstream reasoning from drifting into prophecy or authority.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Downstream effects are Θ-extended and Ω-distributed; lock-in and exposure concentrate over time."
      - "The pattern becomes an IA-risk when prediction rhetoric replaces Λ and is used as authorization without T/J/TB/R safeguards."
      - "Stable protections are explicit □ scope, Λ uncertainty budgets, Φ update triggers, Χ stop-capability, and usable review/correction channels."
      - "Responsibility rises for roles that control frames, embedding, and enforcement; low-exit roles face unfairly high burden zones."
    maturity_summary: |
      In terms of maturity in practice, the pattern can show strong institutional coherence and responsibility rhetoric while remaining mixed on scope humility and revision stewardship under propagation and lock-in pressure.
    ia_box_summary: |
      Structurally, the asymmetry becomes problematic when downstream-effect claims are operationalized as final settlement without clear criteria, timed review, or usable correction and exit channels.
    dignity_summary: ""
    trajectory_summary: |
      Over time, the pattern often moves from bounded hypothesis work into stabilization and then into brittleness as contexts shift; where review and correction pathways exist, it can stabilize without crisis-driven updating.
    open_questions_summary: |
      Key open questions are domain scope, the real distribution of exit options and contest costs, and whether functioning review and correction pathways exist for those most affected.
    conclusion: |
      In sum, the model suggests that the main failure is not downstream reasoning itself but converting it into certainty and authority. For practice design, keep scope explicit, keep uncertainty visible, audit who bears the burdens, and ensure review and correction rights remain usable as conditions change.

        - Note: Justification of downstream-derived constraints varies strongly (safety-critical vs discretionary); criteria remain implicit.
        - Suggested patch: Add if/then criteria for when downstream constraints are justified and which safeguards are mandatory for T/J/TB/R.
      - [medium (relevant uncertainty / visible leverage)] Scope breadth risks scope leakage
        - Target: case.snapshot.short_case_description

        - Target: case.biases_case_level.counter_reading_outline
        - Type: counter_reading_missing
        - Note: A counter-reading exists but lacks concrete scenarios showing mature downstream stewardship with safeguards.
        - Suggested patch: Add 1–2 concrete counter-examples and show how safeguards preserve Χ and T/J/TB/R.
