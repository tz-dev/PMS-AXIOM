        why_this_addon: >
          PMS core can model framing (□), non-events (Λ), attractors (Α), asymmetry (Ω),
          temporality (Θ), recontextualization (Φ), distance (Χ), integration (Σ), and
          binding (Ψ). But PMS core alone does not name or track the critique-specific
          configuration in which legitimacy (uptake, deference, “you should listen”)
          emerges without mandate, and can drift into covert authorization. The CRITIQUE
          overlay introduces reach discipline, legitimacy hygiene, and drift markers
          that keep critique descriptive/coordinative rather than sanction-like.

    context: >
      In a social, organizational, or public setting, an actor/position is treated as
      normatively compelling or guidance-setting despite lacking formal authority,
      mandate, or enforcement power. Others orient behavior accordingly—sometimes as
      voluntary coordination, sometimes as quasi-obligation. The configuration often
      stabilizes through repeated citation, shared deference norms, and implicit
      penalties for refusal (even when no formal penalty exists).
    frame:
      frame_anchor: >
        Legitimacy-as-guidance detached from authority: how deference, coordination,
        and normative “ought” can be generated by uptake, framing, and reach without
        mandate—while remaining interruptible and non-coercive.
      protected_constraints:
        - "Scene-bound analysis; no global authority claims."
        - "Distance (Χ) remains interruptible and revisable (no fusion into verdict)."
        - "No conversion of legitimacy into coercive authority or sanction logic."
        - "Reach discipline: do not scale local critique into general governance."
      out_of_frame:
        - "Normative justification of legitimacy (who deserves it)."
        - "Legal/institutional authority adjudication."
        - "Moral evaluation or ranking of actors."
        - "Enforcement recommendations."
    temporality:
      time_scale: "mid-to-long (weeks to years)"
      iteration_rhythm: "recurrent reference, reuse, and citation"
      persistence_mechanisms:
        - "repeated citation (quoting / referencing as justification)"
        - "customary deference norms (what 'people do')"
        - "institutional memory (archives, reputational traces)"
        - "platform/audience amplification (optional)"
      reversibility_window: >
        Initially open (questioning/refusal feasible); narrows as legitimacy stabilizes
        and becomes taken-for-granted (Χ priced; dissent treated as “out of line”).
    roles:
      - role_label: "R1_legitimacy_holder"
        function: "Source of critique/guidance treated as normatively relevant."
        exposure_profile: >
          Moderate: visibility and influence without corresponding formal accountability;
          may carry reputational risk but not mandate-based responsibility.
        notes: >
          Legitimacy accrues via uptake/citation, not delegation. Risk corridor: being
          treated (or self-presented) as authority-by-default.
      - role_label: "R2_receivers"
        function: "Actors orienting behavior based on perceived legitimacy."
        exposure_profile: >
          Variable: coordination risk, reputational risk for dissent, opportunity costs
          of misalignment; can be high when legitimacy is audience-backed.
        notes: >
          May treat legitimacy as obligation; may comply to avoid social cost even if
          formal refusal is allowed.
      - role_label: "R3_bystanders / audience / peers"
        function: "Stabilize legitimacy through alignment, silence, or amplification."
        exposure_profile: "Often low direct cost; can be high amplification leverage."
        notes: >
          Indirect reinforcement via Α scripts (deference rituals; “everyone knows”),
          and via framing refusal as deviance.

  structural_triggers:
    delta_difference: >
      Mismatch between (a) formal authority structures and (b) perceived need for
      orientation/competence/trust (coordination demand exceeds mandate capacity).
    nabla_impulse: >
      Pressure to obtain guidance/clarity quickly despite missing authorization:
      coordination urgency, uncertainty reduction, and “someone must say what to do.”
    lambda_expected_non_events:
      - "No formal authorization or delegation occurs (Λ: mandate absent)."
      - "No explicit boundary-setting of scope ('advice' vs 'rule') occurs."
      - "No clear refusal-protection is articulated (Χ not protected)."
      - "No accountability interface is created for the legitimacy holder (Σ incomplete)."

  operator_mapping:
    operator_chain: ["Ψ","Σ","Χ","Φ","Θ","Ω","Α","Λ","□","∇","Δ"]
    reduced_signature: >
      LW-AUTH = □(guidance-legibility) + Λ(mandate absent) + Α(uptake/deference scripts) + Ω(influence gradient)
               across Θ, with Χ protected and Σ coordinative (Ψ optional but must remain non-coercive).
    operator_notes:
      delta_difference: >
        Δ distinguishes “authority” (mandate/enforcement) from “legitimacy” (uptake/trust) and
        highlights gaps between formal structures and coordination needs.
      impulse_nabla: >
        ∇ seeks closure/orientation: actors want workable guidance even without mandate.
      frame_box: >
        □ allows legitimacy to function as guidance: “credible/reasonable” becomes
        action-relevant without formal authorization.
      lambda_residue: >
        Λ is the structured absence of authorization: the missing mandate is not filled,
        but can be normalized/forgotten (danger: Λ becomes invisible).
      attractor_alpha: >
        Α stabilizes deference scripts: repeated citation, customary alignment, and
        ritualized “listen to X” behavior.
      omega_asymmetry: >
        Ω emerges as influence gradients: visibility, credibility, platform reach,
        and social leverage become unevenly distributed despite absent mandate.
      theta_temporality: >
        Θ hardens uptake into legitimacy over time; what began as helpful guidance
        becomes default expectation.
      recontext_phi: >
        Φ reframes legitimacy as competence/trust/responsibility (“they know better”),
        which can support coordination—or launder authority if it becomes unquestionable.
      distance_chi: >
        Χ must remain real and safe: interruption, questioning, and refusal must be
        possible without penalty; Χ is not “disrespect,” it is the reversibility carrier.
      integration_sigma: >
        Σ can occur without enforcement: coordination interfaces (shared procedures,
        feedback loops, explicit scope) can stabilize guidance as non-coercive.
      binding_psi: >
        Ψ is optional: if present, it must bind as self-restraint (Ψ→Self) to keep scope,
        accountability, and reversibility intact. Drift corridor: Ψ externalizes (“you must”)
        or binds to identity/standing, converting legitimacy into obligation.
    dependency_hygiene_note: >
      Treating legitimacy as authority collapses Χ (interruptibility) and violates the
      description/application firewall. “Legitimacy → obligation → sanction” is a drift,
      not a justified upgrade.

          The scene stays valid when legitimacy remains interruptible: distinctions stay clear,

        formula: "Δ + □ + Χ + Φ + Σ"
        how_it_applies_here: >
          Guidance supports coordination through explicit scope and interfaces: recontextualization
          clarifies what is being claimed, and integration builds non-coercive coordination.
    drift_candidates:

        label: "Judgment Drift"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Uptake hardens into evaluative authority: critique becomes standing/ranking, and dissent is
          treated as moral failure rather than disagreement.
      - drift_id: "C8"
        label: "Public Pillory"
        why_plausible_here: >
          In public contexts, legitimacy substitutes for sanction: audience-backed pressure turns
          guidance into enforcement-by-exposure.
      - drift_id: "P-Ψ-EXT"
        label: "Ψ Externalization (“You must…”)"
        why_plausible_here: >
          Legitimacy language becomes obligation language; receivers are bound while the holder does not
          self-bind to scope/accountability.
    added_visibility_vs_pms_core: >
      CRITIQUE clarifies (i) the difference between guidance legitimacy and authority, (ii) reach and
      audience amplification as stabilization mechanisms, and (iii) the drift corridor where legitimacy
      laundered through uptake becomes covert authorization.

    observable_markers:
      - "Legitimacy treated as obligation ('you must comply') despite no mandate."

      - "Scope creep: local guidance scaled into general governance claims."
      - "Audience used as enforcement proxy (exposure as sanction)."

  cost_and_exposure:
    omega_exposure_gradients: >
      Legitimacy holders can influence others at low formal cost; receivers bear coordination risk,
      misalignment costs, and reputational exposure if refusal is framed as deviance.
    theta_time_costs_lock_in: >
      Over time, legitimacy becomes difficult to question: reversal is interpreted as instability,
      disloyalty, or incompetence; Χ becomes priced.
    lambda_residue_load: >
      The missing authorization (Λ) is forgotten, ignored, or treated as irrelevant; this enables
      silent conversion from advice to quasi-rule.

  rational_response_envelope:
    structurally_rational_behaviors:
      - "Following guidance to maintain coordination under uncertainty."
      - "Deferring publicly while privately disagreeing to avoid social cost."

  dignity_in_practice:
    D_stress_test_included: true
    risk_point: "Legitimacy becomes coercive through social pressure or exposure."
    structural_indicator: >
      Refusal framed as deviance/immaturity; questioning treated as attack; audience used as penalty;
      dignity breaks appear when standing is reduced to force compliance.
    validity_reminder: >
      Using legitimacy to coerce, shame, rank, or impose irreversible labels violates PMS entry conditions.

  reader_guard:
    not_claimed:
      - "That legitimacy is justified or unjustified."
      - "That authority should or should not exist."
      - "That the legitimacy holder is acting in bad faith."
    claimed:
      - "Legitimacy can structurally arise without authority via uptake, framing, and stabilization."
      - "It remains viable only while interruptible (Χ), scene-bound, and coordinative (Σ)."
      - "Drift risk exists when legitimacy hardens into obligation or sanction-by-audience."
    misuse_warning: >
      High misuse risk if legitimacy language is used to enforce compliance (covert authority laundering).
      Keep scope explicit, protect refusal, and maintain reversibility.

  structural_closure: >
    Legitimacy without authority is structurally viable when guidance remains interruptible (Χ),
    scope-limited and scene-bound (□), and primarily coordinative rather than coercive (Σ).
    It drifts when uptake hardens into obligation, refusal is penalized, reach creeps upward, or
    audience/exposure is used as enforcement proxy—turning legitimacy into covert authorization.

  plain_language_summary: >
    Sometimes people follow someone’s guidance not because they have power, but because they trust it.
    That can help a group coordinate. It becomes a problem when the advice quietly turns into a rule:
    questioning feels unsafe, refusal gets punished, and “legitimacy” starts functioning like authority.
