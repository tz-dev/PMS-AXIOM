    assumptions_and_inferences: |
      - Pattern-level structural reading only (no concrete vignette, identifiable persons, or institution specified).
      - “Legitimacy” is treated descriptively as uptake-based guidance that can coordinate action without formal mandate.
      - The main IA risk corridor is legitimacy→authority laundering: guidance becomes obligation via social pressure, evaluation tokens, or public dynamics.
      - Responsibility allocation (M) is leverage-dependent: higher where actors control frames, channels, reputational pricing, or visibility gradients; lower where alternatives are structurally constrained.
    quality_and_limits:
      coverage_estimate: "medium"
      reliability_estimate: "medium"
      known_gaps:
        - "No concrete vignette/data; scenario remains template-level."
        - "No specified embedding (team/org/public) and no specified decision gates or mandates."
        - "No explicit participation/consent mechanics for receivers (opt-out, dissent protection)."
        - "No explicit time-bounds, review windows, or sunset rules for legitimacy claims."
        - "No explicit publicity level; public amplification effects on Ω/Θ/Χ remain parameterized only abstractly."
      main_bias_risks_here:
        - "abstraction_bias (overfitting the template to too-many real cases)"
        - "halo_effect (competence/charisma treated as normative warrant)"
        - "status_quo_bias (treating emergent legitimacy as “just how it works”)"
        - "in_group_bias (legitimacy recognized more readily for in-group roles)"
        - "hindsight_bias (treating later stabilization as inevitable or intended)"

  snapshot:
    short_case_description: |
      A practice pattern where guidance or critique is treated as normatively compelling despite lacking formal authority or mandate.
      Uptake-based legitimacy can coordinate action, but can drift into covert obligation if refusal becomes costly, interruption is priced,
      or public dynamics harden deference scripts over time.

    guiding_question: |
      How can uptake-based legitimacy remain interruptible (Χ), scope-bounded (□), time-bounded (TB), and practically reversible (R),
      so that coordination (Σ) does not drift into covert authorization, coercion, or sanction-like pressure under Ω/Θ?

      label: "Legitimacy generated without formal authority"

    publicity_degree: "variable (parameterized)"

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: |
      - Structural distinction: legitimacy via uptake ≠ authority via mandate/enforcement.
      - Entry constraint: refusal/interruptibility (Χ) must remain practically possible.
      - Protected good: coordination without covert coercion; no conversion of legitimacy into sanction logic.
      - Drift boundary: legitimacy becomes problematic when treated as obligation without transparency, justification, time-bounds, or reversibility (IA-box).
    variable_elements: |
      - Embedding: team/organisation vs community vs institutional/public setting.
      - Publicity level: private vs institutional vs media-amplified (Ω steepening; Θ hardening).
      - Channel mechanics: meetings, chat, public statements, documentation reuse, “citation” practices.
      - Consent/opt-out: whether receivers can refuse without penalty; whether dissent is protected.
      - Review design: explicit sunset rules, reconsideration triggers, or appeal paths.
      - Scope discipline: what the legitimacy-holder is “allowed to mean” inside the active □.
    unfair_high_M_zones: |
      - Where receivers have low alternatives and refusal is structurally priced, assigning high M for “not resisting” is unfair.
      - Where public exposure or institutional dependency steepens Ω, individual M for dissent is capped; designer/institutional M rises.
      - Where mandates are ambiguous or implicit, blaming individuals for “not clarifying” is often structurally unfair unless they control the frame.
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: |
      - “That’s just how it works here” used to avoid scope-setting, opt-out protection, or review windows.
      - “Everyone follows them” used as pseudo-justification while refusal remains penalized (Χ formal-only).
      - “We trust them” used as authority token to end deliberation rather than to keep coordination corrigible.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: |
        Actors may perceive that guidance is being treated as compelling without mandate, but may misread it as “natural leadership” or “obvious correctness” rather than uptake-driven legitimacy.
        Receivers often sense refusal costs earlier than legitimacy-holders acknowledge them.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: |
        Refusal becomes socially costly; dissent is reframed as immaturity/deviance; “everyone knows we must” talk appears;
        repeated citation replaces explicit decision; legitimacy-holder’s statements harden into precedent; ambiguity about scope persists.
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: |
        Confusing “helpful guidance” with “normative obligation”; treating competence/visibility as authorization;
        ignoring how Ω and publicity price Χ; diffusion of responsibility (Ψ) interpreted as “no one decided.”
    coherence:
      official_narratives: |
        “They don’t have authority, but…” “We should follow their lead.” “That’s the responsible stance.”
        “Refusal would be reckless.” “This is just best practice.” “They represent the standard.”
      visible_enactments: |
        Deference scripts stabilize; guidance is treated as default rule; refusal is subtly penalized;
        mandates remain absent while coordination happens; repeated citation and institutional memory harden uptake.
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: |
        Coherence breaks when “voluntary guidance” is enacted as obligation, when dissent channels exist formally but are priced (Χ formal-only),
        or when “no mandate” is said while sanction-like pressure is applied indirectly.
    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: |
        - Make scope explicit: what legitimacy claims cover (and do not cover) inside □.
        - Keep Χ real: protect refusal/clarification without reputational penalty, especially under Ω/publicity.
        - Require time-bounds: set review windows and reconsideration triggers so Θ does not harden into precedent.
        - Separate guidance from governance: prevent legitimacy language from substituting for decision procedures or mandates.
        - Allocate responsibility by leverage: higher where actors control framing, channels, and reputational pricing.
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: |
        Responsibility shifts into “soft coercion”: “we’re not forcing you” while refusal is penalized.
        Ownership diffuses: “everyone agrees” replaces explicit decision; bystanders stabilize without taking Ψ.
        Refusal appears as silence-as-steering or as reframing dissent into character/tone categories.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: |
        Receivers may self-censor, comply against judgment, or exit; coordination becomes brittle and resentful.
        Third parties learn that uptake dynamics can operate like authority, normalizing covert governance.
    power:
      formal_power_distribution: |
        Template-level: legitimacy-holder lacks formal mandate, but may hold informal status, expertise, or platform reach depending on embedding.
      factual_power_distribution: |
        Influence arises via uptake, reputational pricing, and channel control; bystanders can amplify; publicness steepens Ω and accelerates Θ hardening.
      used_alternatives: |
        - Social pressure and evaluative reframes (“responsible people comply”).
        - Public signaling (endorsement, citation) that stabilizes deference scripts (Α).
        - Ambiguity maintenance: acting “as if” mandate exists without stating it.
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: |
        - Explicit scope statements and opt-out protections (Χ safeguards).
        - Time-bounded pilots and review windows (TB).
        - Clear separation between advice, coordination proposals, and binding decisions (□ hygiene).
        - Protected dissent/appeal channels with correction propagation (R).
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: |
        D module remains OFF. Dignity risk is handled structurally: the main risk is degrading receivers via shaming/immaturity frames for refusal,
        converting voluntary guidance into coercive pressure under Ω/publicity.

  ia_protection:
    if_then_criteria: |
      If/then criteria to separate healthy uptake-based legitimacy (advisory) from authority laundering (binding-like):

      Advisory / healthy legitimacy (LOW IA risk) IF:
      - Scope is explicit: “what this guidance covers / does not cover.”
      - Refusal is safe: dissent/opt-out is practically available without penalty (Χ real).
      - Accountability is explicit: the legitimacy-holder accepts correction, updates, and responsibility for claims (Ψ→Self, not Ψ→Other).
      - Review exists: time-bounded reassessment cadence or triggers are stated (TB present).
      - Revisions propagate: when guidance changes, downstream expectations and records are updated (R present).

      Drift toward covert authority (HIGHER IA risk) IF ANY:
      - Obligation language appears without mandate (“you must” / “responsible people comply”) and refusal is priced.
      - Scope creep occurs (local guidance treated as general rule/standard) without explicit decision gates.
      - Public exposure/audience is used as sanction proxy (compliance enforced by reputational threat).
      - “Everyone agrees / everyone follows” replaces a decision procedure and hides who owns Ψ.
      - Corrections do not propagate (old guidance remains cited as precedent after revision).
    transparency_measures: |
      - State scope explicitly: what the legitimacy-holder’s guidance covers and what it does not.
      - Separate advice from decision: document when something is recommendation vs binding policy (if any).
      - Make refusal rules explicit: what dissent looks like and how it is handled without penalty.
      - Track uptake vs mandate: record when legitimacy is being treated as obligation and why.
    time_bound_measures: |
      - Set review windows for legitimacy-based coordination: periodic reconsideration rather than indefinite deference.
      - Use sunset rules for standing “guidance defaults” to prevent Θ hardening into precedent.
      - Trigger review when refusal/dissent patterns appear or when publicness escalates.
    reversibility_measures: |
      - Provide protected dissent/opt-out channels that do not price Χ (no retaliation, no reputational penalty).
      - Ensure correction propagation: if guidance is revised, update downstream expectations and records.
      - Use bounded pilots where possible so coordination remains corrigible rather than normative.
    participation_of_affected:
      level: "consulted"
      examples: "Consult receivers on refusal costs and opt-out design; ensure feedback can change scope rules, review cadence, and channel mechanics."

  trajectory:
    key_timepoints:
      - label: "t0"
        short_description: "Coordination need arises; guidance is followed despite no mandate; scope remains implicit."
        A_band_at_t: "A ≈ 5–7/10"
        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 2–7/10 (rises with framing/channel control)"
      - label: "t1"
        short_description: "Repeated uptake stabilizes deference scripts (Α); missing mandate is normalized (Λ); refusal starts to be priced (Χ)."
        A_band_at_t: "A ≈ 4–6/10"
        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 3–8/10 (bystander amplification and legitimacy-holder scope failures matter)"
      - label: "t2"
        short_description: "Θ hardening: legitimacy becomes taken-for-granted obligation; review windows absent; reversibility mostly formal; public dynamics can escalate."
        A_band_at_t: "A ≈ 4–6/10 (depends on TB/R safeguards)"
        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 4–8/10 (highest where actors institutionalize pressure without mandate)"
    course_in_words: |
      The pattern often begins as pragmatic coordination via trust and perceived competence.
      Over repeated cycles, uptake stabilizes deference scripts and the absence of mandate becomes backgrounded, while refusal is increasingly priced.
      Without explicit scope, time-bounds, and protected dissent, legitimacy drifts into covert authorization and becomes difficult to revise once precedent accumulates.
    responsibility_viability_range: |
      Viability is highest when legitimacy remains explicitly voluntary, scope-bounded, reviewed, and practically reversible via protected refusal and correction propagation.
      Viability collapses when legitimacy functions as obligation without mandate and when dissent is penalized, especially under public amplification.

    unclear_points: |
      - What is the concrete embedding (team/org/public), and what decision gates exist?
      - What is the concrete publicity level, and how does it change refusal pricing (Χ) and Θ hardening?
      - What explicit scope statements exist (what is guidance vs what is binding policy, if any)?
      - What review windows, sunset rules, or reconsideration triggers exist (TB)?
      - What practical refusal/appeal paths exist, and do they change downstream expectations (R)?
    missing_data_or_perspectives: |
      - A concrete vignette showing the initial coordination need, uptake dynamics, and refusal costs.
      - Receivers’ perspective on alternatives and dependency (pricing of Χ).
      - Legitimacy-holder’s perspective on intended scope, accountability, and openness to revision.
      - Evidence about whether dissent changes outcomes or only updates narratives.
    distortion_risks: |
      - Overgeneralizing: treating all informal leadership as IA rather than distinguishing voluntary coordination from coercive drift.
      - Halo bias: competence/visibility treated as normative authorization without accountability.
      - Moralization drift: framing drift as malicious intent rather than incentive-stabilized scripts and channel dynamics.

  biases_case_level:
    initial_intuition: |
      Legitimacy without authority is often viable and even necessary for coordination, but becomes risky when refusal costs rise and legitimacy language starts functioning like mandate.
      The key drift marker is obligation talk without explicit scope, review, or reversibility.
    named_bias_risks:
      - "halo_effect"
      - "status_quo_bias"
      - "in_group_bias"
      - "confirmation_bias"
      - "hindsight_bias"
    counter_reading_outline: |
      Counter-reading: In many settings, informal legitimacy is a justified coordination mechanism where formal authority is absent or slow.
      Apparent “obligation” may reflect urgent risk management rather than covert coercion.
      Before classifying drift as IA risk, test: (1) scope explicitness, (2) protected opt-out/refusal, (3) time-bounded review, (4) correction propagation.
      If these hold, legitimacy can remain advisory and corrigible even under strong coordination pressure.

  analyst_reflection:
    self_implication_notes: |
      Analytic framing can itself launder authority: describing legitimacy drift can be heard as a verdict about a person or group.
      This reading therefore stays structural, keeps justification out of scope, and centers design variables: scope, refusal protection, review windows, and reversibility.
    possible_next_steps: |
      - Add one concrete vignette and map: channels, publicity level, refusal costs, and how legitimacy is cited and reused.
      - Add explicit if/then criteria: when guidance is advisory vs when formal decision procedures must be invoked. (Now included at template level; instantiate it in the concrete embedding.)
      - Add review cadence and sunset rules so Θ hardening does not convert guidance into precedent.
      - Add protected dissent/opt-out mechanics and correction propagation for downstream expectations.

    title: "Praxeological analysis of a practice pattern: Legitimacy generated without formal authority"
    one_paragraph_overview: |
      This reading treats “legitimacy without authority” as a practice pattern where people orient their behavior to guidance or critique that lacks formal mandate.
      The question is not whether the guidance is correct, but whether the situation keeps guidance voluntary, scope-bounded, reviewable, and practically reversible.
      Over time, repeated uptake can harden into deference scripts and make refusal costly, especially under public exposure and reputational dynamics.
      The analysis therefore centers design variables that keep coordination corrigible: explicit scope, protected refusal and dissent, review windows, and correction propagation when guidance changes.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Risk mechanism: uptake-based legitimacy can harden under Θ into deference scripts (Α) while missing mandate (Λ) is normalized; refusal/interruptibility (Χ) becomes priced."
      - "IA risk rises when legitimacy functions like obligation without transparency, justification, time-bounds, or practical reversibility."
      - "Responsibility is leverage-dependent: highest where actors control framing, channels, reputational pricing, or public reach; lower where receivers have low alternatives."
      - "Safer coordination keeps guidance advisory via explicit scope, protected dissent, time-bounded review, and correction propagation."
    maturity_summary: |
      In terms of maturity in practice, the pattern supports adult enactment when guidance remains explicitly voluntary, scope-bounded, and revisable, and when refusal can be exercised without penalty.
    ia_box_summary: |
      Structurally, IA risk increases when the asymmetry is not transparent, not justified by symmetric opt-out and accountability, not time-bounded by review windows, and not practically reversible through protected dissent and correction propagation.
    dignity_summary: ""
    trajectory_summary: |
      Over time, the pattern often moves from pragmatic coordination to stabilized deference unless explicit scope and review design prevent Θ hardening and keep refusal (Χ) real.
    open_questions_summary: |
      Important open questions are the concrete embedding and publicity level, how refusal is priced, whether scope is explicit, and whether time-bounded review and practical reversibility exist.
    conclusion: |
      Use this case to keep coordination from turning into covert authority: make scope explicit, protect refusal and dissent, require review windows, and ensure reversibility through correction propagation.
      Where public exposure steepens costs, add extra safeguards so legitimacy does not become sanction-like pressure.
