    secondary_material: ""
    assumptions_and_inferences: |
      - Pattern-level structural reading only (no concrete vignette, identifiable persons, or institution specified).
      - “Interpretability vs reality” is treated as a regime risk: explanatory clarity is mistaken for adequacy, producing Φ-closure without Σ/Ψ.
      - IA box is used as a legitimacy screen for drift into authority laundering (clarity→entitlement), symbolic closure, and outcome externalization.
      - Responsibility allocation (M) is leverage-dependent: higher where actors control evaluation criteria, documentation, and decision gates; lower where alternatives are structurally blocked.

      reliability_estimate: "medium"
      known_gaps:

        - "No specified institutional embedding (team/board/public episode) and no explicit decision gates."
        - "No concrete outcome metrics, harm profile, or correction channel specified."
        - "No explicit reversibility mechanisms (pilots, rollbacks, sunset rules) specified beyond template suggestions."
        - "No stakeholder participation detail (who is consulted, how feedback changes decisions)."
      main_bias_risks_here:
        - "abstraction_bias (overfitting the template to too-many real cases)"
        - "status_quo_bias (treating explanation as adequate because it is legible)"
        - "halo_effect (clarity/eloquence treated as competence/rightness)"
        - "hindsight_bias (treating drift as inevitable without mapping alternatives)"
        - "technocratic_legibility_bias (preferring what can be narrated/measured over what changes outcomes)"

  snapshot:
    short_case_description: |
      A critique configuration prioritizes making a situation interpretable and narratively coherent.
      Explanations proliferate and gain acceptance, while practical reality remains unchanged.
      Interpretability becomes closure, displacing correction (Σ) and follow-up ownership (Ψ), often under documentation hardening (Θ) and exposure gradients (Ω).
    central_actors_and_roles:
      - "R1_explainer_interpreter"
      - "R2_affected_party_reality_bearer"
      - "R3_audience_evaluators"
    guiding_question: |
      How can sense-making (Φ) remain interruptible (Χ) and reality-aligned by producing consolidatable correction (Σ) and follow-up ownership (Ψ),
      while preventing drift where interpretability becomes authority, closure, or an exposure substitute under Ω/Θ?

  role_mapping:
    object_of_observation:
      type: "practice_pattern"
      label: "Interpretability substitution (explanation-as-closure)"
      description: "A regime where explanatory coherence (Φ) is treated as sufficient closure, while Σ correction and Ψ follow-up ownership remain absent; Χ is formally available but does not interrupt the explanatory attractor (Α), and Θ hardens narratives through artifacts."

    publicity_degree: "variable"

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: |
      - Structural distinction: interpretability (explanation quality) ≠ reality alignment (outcome change).
      - Φ without Σ/Ψ constitutes drift risk; explanation cannot substitute for integration and binding.
      - Under Ω, those affected by unchanged reality can be structurally out-voiced by narrative authority.
      - Under Θ, documents/dashboards can harden narratives and decision inertia.
    variable_elements: |
      - Embedding type: internal meeting/review cycle vs public episode vs institutional governance.
      - Artifact types and durability: reports/dashboards/memos vs posts/media clips; archiving and searchability.
      - Decision gates and accountability design: who decides, how criteria are set, and how outcomes are tracked.
      - Presence/absence of Σ corridors: pilots, concrete interventions, resource commitments, operational changes.
      - Ψ follow-up ownership: explicit owner vs diffusion across committees/audiences.
      - Correction windows and contestation norms: whether Χ interruptions are protected or penalized.
    unfair_high_M_zones: |
      - Where decision gates are opaque and alternatives are blocked, assigning high M to affected parties is structurally unfair.
      - Where outcomes depend on institutional levers (budgets, staffing, platform controls), M rises primarily at leverage holders, not at those bearing consequences.
      - Where Θ hardening locks narratives into policy without review, blaming individuals for “not convincing enough” misreads the structure.
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: |
      - “We already explained it; therefore it’s solved” used to avoid Σ commitments and Ψ follow-up.
      - “It’s too complex to change” asserted without testing minimal Σ corridors (pilots, bounded interventions).
      - “The dashboard says we’re fine” used to dismiss lived impact without checking measurement validity or blind spots.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: |
        Actors may notice the felt gap between lived outcomes and official explanations, but may misread clarity as adequacy.
        Reality bearers often detect persistence of mismatch even as interpretability improves.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: |
        Repeated explanation rounds; improved narratives without operational change; “closure by clarity” rhetoric;
        requests for concrete steps redirected into more analysis; outcome indicators unchanged; affected parties report stable harms.
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: |
        Confusing interpretability with correctness; treating narrative coherence as completion; mistaking documentation for action;
        role drift where explainers become de facto governors; loss of follow-up ownership (Ψ diffusion).
    coherence:
      official_narratives: |
        “Now we understand the problem.” “The model explains it.” “We have a clear story.” “We need better framing.”
        “The dashboard shows progress.” “Let’s align on the narrative.”
      visible_enactments: |
        Production of decks/reports/dashboards; review cycles centered on interpretation; repeated reframing (Φ);
        limited or symbolic actions; success measured by legibility; affected parties’ signals treated as anecdotal.
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: |
        Coherence breaks when “we’re addressing it” is enacted as explanation production only,
        or when “we will follow up” is declared without an owner, timeline, or measurable Σ corridor.
    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: |
        - Keep Φ interruptible (Χ): allow challenges that separate explanation quality from outcome adequacy.
        - Require Σ corridors: translate explanation into bounded, coordinatable correction steps (pilots, resourcing, process changes).
        - Bind Ψ follow-up ownership: assign an accountable owner for outcome tracking and corrective iteration.
        - Allocate responsibility by leverage: higher where actors control criteria, documentation, decision gates, and resources.
        - Protect reality signals: prevent narrative authority from invalidating affected-party impact reports.
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: |
        Responsibility often shifts from outcomes to narratives: success is claimed via interpretability.
        Follow-up diffuses across audiences/committees, while affected parties are tasked with “providing more clarity.”
        Refusal appears as endless analysis loops or symbolic commitments that do not change constraints.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: |
        Outcomes remain unchanged while legitimacy claims rise; affected parties experience ongoing costs and reduced voice.
        Third parties learn that legibility wins over correction, stabilizing cynicism and future under-reporting of problems.
    power:
      formal_power_distribution: |
        Template-level: varies by embedding; evaluators and decision-makers may formalize what counts as success (interpretability vs outcomes).
      factual_power_distribution: |
        Explainability producers can shape meaning and criteria; evaluators can gate resources; affected parties bear consequences but often lack leverage to force Σ.
      used_alternatives: |
        - Refining explanations to satisfy evaluators.
        - Reframing (Φ) to preserve legitimacy.
        - Documentation as proxy for accountability.
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: |
        - Bounded pilots and concrete corrective actions (Σ corridors).
        - Clear follow-up ownership with review checkpoints (Ψ).
        - Outcome-based criteria replacing narrative-based criteria.
        - Sunset/reversal protocols for narrative-driven decisions (Θ safeguards).
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: |
        D module remains OFF. Dignity risk is handled structurally: the primary risk is invalidating lived impact via narrative authority,
        silencing reality bearers, and using interpretability to dismiss harm signals under Ω/Θ.

        - "A drops when narrative clarity is used as success criterion, displacing outcome checks and Σ commitments."

  ia_protection:
    transparency_measures: |
      - Separate explanation quality vs adequacy: state what is known, what is hypothesized, and what remains unchanged in outcomes.
      - Name incentives and criteria: clarify who benefits from interpretability as success and what counts as success operationally.
      - Document decision gates: who decides, on what basis, and how outcome evidence is weighted vs narrative coherence.
      - Preserve dissent channels: protect Χ interruptions that challenge explanations without reputational penalty.
    time_bound_measures: |
      - Set bounded “interpretation windows” after which a Σ corridor must be proposed or the explanation loop is paused.
      - Add review checkpoints tied to outcomes (not only interpretability) and require explicit renewal to continue explanation rounds.
      - Use sunset clauses for narrative-driven policies or official explanations when outcome improvement is not observed.
    reversibility_measures: |
      - Prefer pilots with rollback options over permanent narrative-driven commitments.
      - Build correction propagation: when explanation changes, ensure downstream documents and decisions are updated (not just revised in place).
      - Prevent downstream coupling: do not treat explanatory clarity as warrant for sanctions or irreversible allocations without outcome evidence.
    participation_of_affected:

      - label: "t1"

        A_band_at_t: "A ≈ 3–6/10 (depends on safeguards for Χ/Σ/Ψ)"
        M_band_at_t: "M ≈ 4–8/10 (highest where narratives are operationalized without outcome checks)"
    course_in_words: |
      The pattern moves from an initial mismatch toward an explanatory attractor where interpretability is rewarded and becomes closure.
      As artifacts accumulate, Θ hardens narratives, and without Σ corridors and Ψ follow-up ownership, outcomes remain unchanged.
      Where interruption rights (Χ) and outcome checkpoints are protected, explanation can remain a tool rather than a substitute.
    responsibility_viability_range: |
      Viability is highest when explanation is time-bounded, outcome-checked, and coupled to a concrete Σ corridor with explicit Ψ ownership.
      Viability collapses when narrative authority replaces correction and when artifact hardening prevents revision from altering consequences.

  open_questions_and_blind_spots:
    unclear_points: |
      - What is the concrete embedding (team/organisation/governance/public episode), and what decision gates exist?
      - What artifacts are produced, how durable are they, and how do they propagate into downstream decisions?
      - What outcomes are considered “reality alignment” here, and how are they measured/validated?
      - Who owns follow-up (Ψ), and what are the correction windows and rollback mechanisms (Χ/Θ safeguards)?
    missing_data_or_perspectives: |
      - A concrete vignette describing the mismatch, the explanation rounds, and the decision consequences.
      - Affected parties’ perspectives on what counts as adequacy and what harms persist despite interpretability.
      - Evidence on whether revised explanations change downstream consequences or merely update narratives in place.
    distortion_risks: |
      - Overgeneralizing from the template to contexts where explanation is a necessary prerequisite for safe action.
      - Moralization drift: treating narrative production as deception rather than incentive-driven closure pressure.
      - Technocratic bias: assuming measurement/dashboards are inherently authoritative rather than contested instruments.

  biases_case_level:
    initial_intuition: |
      Interpretability substitution is a common drift: clarity feels like progress, so explanation becomes closure while reality remains unchanged.
      The key risk is that narrative authority displaces correction and binds responsibility to documentation rather than outcomes.
    named_bias_risks:
      - "status_quo_bias"
      - "halo_effect"
      - "confirmation_bias"
      - "hindsight_bias"
      - "technocratic_legibility_bias"
    counter_reading_outline: |
      Counter-reading: In some contexts, explanation work is ethically required before action (to avoid harm), and Σ cannot responsibly form without Φ.
      A safe application must test whether explanation is time-bounded, outcome-checked, and coupled to a concrete pilot/correction corridor,
      rather than assuming drift from interpretability alone.

  analyst_reflection:
    self_implication_notes: |
      Analytic language can reward clarity and inadvertently launder authority: “we understand it” can be heard as “we are done.”
      This reading therefore keeps closure conditions explicit (Σ/Ψ required) and treats interpretability as necessary-but-insufficient.
    possible_next_steps: |
      - Add one concrete vignette and map: artifacts, decision gates, criteria, outcome metrics, and follow-up ownership.
      - Define a “sense-making window” after which a Σ corridor or a deliberate pause must occur.
      - Specify rollback and correction propagation mechanisms so revisions can change consequences (reversibility).

    title: "Praxeological analysis of a practice pattern: Interpretability substitution (explanation-as-closure)"
    one_paragraph_overview: |
      This reading treats “interpretability vs reality” as a practice pattern where explanatory clarity becomes the endpoint and is treated as closure, while practical outcomes remain unchanged.
      The key issue is not whether explanations are sincere or false, but whether sense-making stays interruptible and is coupled to a concrete correction step and follow-up ownership.
      When explanation rounds repeat without consolidation, narratives and documents can harden over time and start functioning as authority or completion signals.
      Those affected by unchanged reality may bear ongoing consequences while their impact signals are discounted by narrative coherence.
      The analysis therefore keeps the unit structural and highlights criteria, ownership, and reversibility safeguards that prevent interpretability from substituting for correction.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Risk mechanism: Φ (interpretation) is inflated while Σ correction and Ψ follow-up ownership remain absent; Χ exists formally but does not interrupt the explanatory attractor."
      - "Under Θ, documents/dashboards can harden narratives into official closure, even when outcomes do not improve."
      - "Under Ω, explainers and evaluators can gain legitimacy with low exposure while reality bearers carry persistent costs with low leverage."
      - "Responsibility is leverage-dependent: highest at criteria setters, decision gates, and resource controllers; lower where alternatives and influence are structurally blocked."
      - "IA risk rises when clarity becomes authority and postponement is indefinite, non-transparent, or non-reversible."
    maturity_summary: |
      In terms of maturity in practice, the pattern supports adult enactment when explanation remains a tool that is time-bounded, outcome-checked, and coupled to a concrete correction corridor with owned follow-up, rather than becoming closure by clarity.
    ia_box_summary: |
      Structurally, IA risk rises when interpretability is treated as sufficient without transparent criteria, justified postponement, time bounds, and reversibility—especially once artifacts harden and revisions no longer change consequences.
    dignity_summary: ""
    trajectory_summary: |
      Over time, the constellation tends to drift from an initial mismatch toward repeated explanation rounds, artifact hardening, and stabilized narrative closure unless correction corridors and follow-up ownership are explicitly designed.
    open_questions_summary: |
      Important open questions are the concrete embedding and decision gates, the durability and propagation of artifacts, what outcomes define adequacy, and which rollback and correction propagation mechanisms exist.
    conclusion: |
      The model suggests using this case to keep interpretability from substituting for correction: separate explanation from adequacy, protect interruption rights, require a bounded corrective corridor, and bind follow-up ownership.
      For safer practice under documentation hardening, add outcome checkpoints, rollback options, and correction propagation so revisions can change downstream consequences rather than only improving narratives.
